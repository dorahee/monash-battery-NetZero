  abstract   = {The ultimate smart grid will operate autonomously by implementing intelligent decision-making schemes with as little consumer intervention as possible. Its success will be heavily reliant on accurate real-time information exchange between the grid and the consumers. Customers will be expected to submit energy demand schedules to actively monitor energy price signals and participate in energy bids and respond to energy management signals in real time. This kind of smart grid-user interaction will be overwhelming and can result in consumer apathy. There is therefore a need to develop intelligent systems that will execute all these tasks without the active involvement of the consumer. This paper proposes such an approach. Demand response scheme by smart scheduling of household electrical appliances is presented. The scheduler calculates individual device hourly probabilities that it uses to automatically generate optimal schedules. An optimal schedule is considered to be the one that meets the consumer's deadlines while ensuring energy cost savings to the customer.},
  comment    = {This research manages the appliances for a single home, based on TOU probabiltiies and RTP prices. 

Background:
- Direct load control vs price control
- DR incentive based

Model:
- shiftable (interruptible and non-interruptible), must-run
- TOU probabilities and schedules for each shiftable device
	* generate time of use pattern of each appliance over the planning horizon, e.g. a month, the scheduler calculates appliances' corresponding probability ofr each hour
	* from the probabilities, the scheduler develops hourly profiles of each household device
	* the probabilities vary depending on the day of the week, weather conditions, degree of penetration of the appliances and the level of occupancy of the house
	* schedules for each device are automatically generated around the highest time slot probabilities
		= there is a tolerance value for each device. This means the allowed deviation from the highest possible start time
		= like an earliest start time and the latest finish time
- delay and frustration cost:
	* each device has a frustration cost when it is delayed or deviated from its highest possible start time
- shiftable and interruptible:
	- can only be interrupted maximum twice

Clusers:
- devices that have similar time of use energy profiels are grouped together in a cluster
- an appliance can belong to multiple clusers and be seen as a different device in each cluster
- each cluster is like the load expected to be activated in a given time period

Thoughts:
- quite a few confusing bits in the paper. 
- the device model and the cluster model are fine but the algorithm and the objective formulation are confusing and unclear

******

Input: start time probabilities of appliances computed from historical demand data

Cost: frustration cost (like inconvenience cost, delay and early cost)

Goal: minimize the peak loads for each cluster
Objective: limit consumption, reduce cost and minimise inconvenience
Optimisation objective: total energy and frustration costs

Constraints: max power for each time zone 

Issues: care must be taken to avoid creating new peaks when the prices are low

Cost function: convex

Method: schedule devices based on their start time probabilities. Cluter devices based on their usual usage times. 
Algorithm: dynamic programming algorithm
1. group devices together based on preferred usage times (from the probabilities?)
2. schedule each appliance based on its start time probability distribution
3. each time zone has a limited amount of energy and prices are updated hourly (given?)
4. schedules are changed continually (when the price changes?)

THOUGHTS
1. CONSTRAINTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED. 
2. I STILL DONT QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW THE WHOLE THINGS WORK
3. INTEND TO TACKLE THE MANUAL RESPONSE AND THE LOAD SYN ISSUES
4. PRICES ARE GIVEN},

  abstract   = {One of the most challenging problems associated with operation of smart micro-grids is the optimal energy management of residential buildings with respect to multiple and often conflicting objectives. In this paper, a multiobjective mixed integer nonlinear programming model is developed for optimal energy use in a smart home, considering a meaningful balance between energy saving and a comfortable lifestyle. Thorough incorporation of a mixed objective function under different system constraints and user preferences, the proposed algorithm could not only reduce the domestic energy usage and utility bills, but also ensure an optimal task scheduling and a thermal comfort zone for the inhabitants. To verify the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, a number of simulations were performed under different scenarios using real data, and the obtained results were compared in terms of total energy consumption cost, users' convenience rates, and thermal comfort level.},

    * minimise cost and discomfort
- cplex and GAMS

Results:
- minimising cost and discomfort improved the mixed objective function up to 55\% and 25\% compared with no control and minimising cost only

Take-aways:

  abstract   = {Demand side management encourages the users in a smart grid to shift their electricity consumption in response to varying electricity prices. In this paper, we propose a distributed framework for the demand response based on cost minimization. Each user in the system will find an optimal start time and operating mode for the appliances in response to the varying electricity prices. We model the cost function for each user and the constraints for the appliances. We then propose an approximate greedy iterative algorithm that can be employed by each user to schedule appliances. In the proposed algorithm, each user requires only the knowledge of the price of the electricity, which depends on the aggregated load of other users, instead of the load profiles of individual users. In order for the users to coordinate with each other, we introduce a penalty term in the cost function, which penalizes large changes in the scheduling between successive iterations. Numerical simulations show that our optimization method will result in lower cost for the consumers, lower generation costs for the utility companies, lower peak load, and lower load fluctuations.},
  comment    = {Abstract: this research manages multiple consumers, to optimise the start times of appliances, to minimise the total costs (including the actual paymenet and two types of preference costs). Only prices and total demand are comunicated between consumers and the utility. Sub-optimal. 


Background: 
- benefits of demenad respone, reduce peak demand and better utilitization by shifting demand. 
- smart pricing: the utility provides time-dependent prices to motivate consumers to shift demand. 
	* Smart meters make it possible for consumers to collect real-time demand data and respond to real-time pricing by automatically controlling their devices using some smart energy management systems. 


This work:
- existing work: variable energy consumption for each appliance, billed by their aggregate demand, appliance-level constraints, jointly compute the optimal start time 
- this work: discrete energy consumption level, so NP-hard. 
- not cooperative (unlike game theoratical/sequential method). 
	* cooperative: additional implementation and communication over head


Model:
- time slot: 24 hourly
- MRT
- SNIT and SIT, flexible start time and flexible operation mode
	* a fixed demand level per mode
	* ideal start time and ideal operation mode
	* SNIT: hold time constraints, min required energy threshold, must finish before the end of the day
	* SIT: LFT
- pricing: marginal cost of the generation cost
	* generation cost function quadratic convex increasing


Problem:
- Objective: 
	* actual cost + 
	* satisfaction cost due to operation mode mismatch: less ideal operating mode cost + 
	* satisfaction cost due to delaying or advancing the operation of an appliance: not at the ideal start time const
- a weight for each part
- load balance constraints


Algorithm:
- centralised, difficult to collect all required info
- distributed, non cooperative
- procedure, at each iteration:
	* utitliy set prices to the marginal costs and broadcastst he prices
	* each user solves the local optimisation problem in response to the prices using a greedy algorithm
- penalty term: 
	* after receiving the price from the utility, the user calculates the cost of using an appliance at time t on mode k using that price and add a penalty cost to that cost
	* when solving the local problem, the user finds a time slot for a task that minimises the modified cost/power of that task (like a modifieid price or a cost density like they said) 
	* a penalty on a change of load schedule between two consecutive iterations for each user
	* penality coefficient:
		= proportional to the ieration index
		= inversely proportional to the cost of the users
- when the cost is convex, then optimal solution, otherwise sub-optimal:
	* at most twice as the optimal cost


Experiment:
- 100 users, each with 10 appliances including base loads and shiftable loads
- compare with sequential/game theory method:
	* sequential: flatter
	* both converged to very similar utility cost and user cost
	* overall, sequential is better, and converged much faster
		= sequential: after abou 15 iterations
		= their: in about 30 iterations, convergence depends on the penalty coefficient (if too small, won't converge)


Thought
- it is a good paper to refer to
- greedy algorithm for local and penalty term, no solver
- utility, just set prices to marginal cost
- compare non cop with cop},

Simulation results indicate that our scheme can not only save money for consumers, but also reduce peak load and the variance between demand and supply, while avoiding the "rebound" peak problem.},
  comment    = {This research forms the power scheduling problem as a Stackelberg game. Consumers schedule appliances, playing the followers and the utility plays the leader. 

Issue: idle infrastructure. peak capacity comes from the most polluting assets. 
Solution: load shifting

Difference: appliance level rather than the household level

Decisions: schedule each appliance's optimal start time

Objective for consumer: minimise the usage cost. Delay/inconvenience cost. 
Usage cost: convex

Objective for the utility: puchased supplied power * retail price - and cost of difference between the planned supply and the actual load

Pricing: prices in a future time window are announced on a rolling basis (e.g. 15 mins beforehand).
The price is the actual wholesale price + a price gap that is calculated by this algorithm
The price gap depends on the difference between the planned supply load and the actual supply load
THOUGHTS: very interesting pricing method

Constraint: Total price gaps of all times

Appliances: power consumption per time slot in the duration, duration

Issue: a 'rebound' peak may appear during what was supposed to be a low load period, because local neighboring consumers may make similar usage decisions

Method:
1. consumer sends a request to use an appliance
2. utility computes the price vector for each incentive factor (WHAT IS THIS INCENTIVE FACTOR) and sends the price vector for each incentive factor to all consumers
3. the consumer requested compute the optimal start time of the appliance for each price vector, and send those optimal start times to the utility
4. the utility calculates the optimal incentive factor, sends it back to all consumers and updates the actual load vector using the optimal start time for that incentive factor
5. the consumer chooses the optimal start time for the appliance given the optimal incentive factor

THOUGHTS: choosing the incentive factor is critical? Didn't explain how long is each time period. 
The utility must be able to handle all requests and the each appliance needs to reveal its details to the utility. Really strange. Does it work?},

The lower-layer network is within each building, where the energy management controller (EMC) uses wireless links to schedule operation of appliances upon request according to a local power consumption target. The upper-layer network links a number of EMCs in a region whose aggregated demand is served by a load aggregator. The load aggregator wants the actual aggregated demand over this region to match a desired aggregated demand profile. Our approach utilizes the average consensus algorithm to distribute portions of the desired aggregated demand to each EMC in a decentralized fashion. The allocated portion corresponds to each building's aforementioned local power consumption target which its EMC then uses to schedule the in-building appliances. The result will be an aggregated demand over this region that more closely reaches the desired demand. Numerical results show that our scheme can alleviate the mismatch between the actual aggregated demand and the desired aggregated demand profile.},

  comment    = {This paper is a starting point to include the appliance level detials and constraints for designing practical demand response (?). 

Background, use the load factor is explain how much of the facilities are under used. 

Contribution: iterative, distributed supply function bidding schemes for the demand response

------

Situation: power supply fluctuate -- deficit and surplus
Bidding scheme for the demand response
N consumers and one utility company

Cost function per consumer: a cost of shedding load. Convex
Meaning: given the price and a parameter, how much load the consumer is willing to shed
THOUGHTS: kind of like the utility function

Utility: total load shed needs
Set a price, each consumer returns the load shed amount from the supply function, and the price needs to incur the total required load she amount. 
THOUGHTS: I think the utility needs to know the paramters of all consumers?

Method (competitive market -- price taking): minimise the total cost function of all consumers while satisfying the total load shed needs
Distributed and iterative algorithm. Step size needs to  be chosen. 

Method (oligopolisitic market -- price antipating, knowing how the prices will be calculated): I don't understand how they came up with the D(x)

------

Situation: consumers receive real-time spot prices

Constraints: minimum and maximum total power requirement per day for each consumer

Utility fo a consumer: using power at each time, concave
Cost for the utility (not price): convex, increasing marginal cost

Objective for the utility: maximise price * supplied power - cost
Objective for a consumer: maximise utility - consumed power * price

Method (competitive market): iterative, distributed. consumers update the demand level per iteration. Step size needs to be chosen. 

Method (oligopolistic market): consumers exchange their total demand

THOUGHTS: very interesting, that they compare both the load shedding situations and load shifting situations. They also consider both the non-cooperative method and the cooperative method for both situations. Although they did not report many results on the comparisons. Also they also considers changing the total consumption without considering appliance details. As they said, it was a starting point.},

  abstract = {Demand response is a key solution in smart grid to address the ever-increasing peak energy consumption. With multiple utility companies, users will decide from which utility company to buy electricity and how much to buy. Consequently, how to devise distributed real-time demand response in the multiseller-multibuyer environment emerges as a critical problem in future smart grid. In this paper, we focus on the real-time interactions among multiple utility companies and multiple users. We propose a distributed real-time demand response algorithm to determine each user's demand and each utility company's supply simultaneously. By applying dual decomposition, the original problem is firstly decoupled into single-seller-multibuyer subsystems; then, the demand response problem in each subsystem can be distributively solved. The major advantage of this approach is that each utility company and user locally solve subproblems to perform energy allocation, instead of requiring a central controller or any third party. Therefore, privacy is guaranteed because no entity needs to reveal or exchange private information. Numerical results are presented to verify efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  comment    = {This research manages thermostatically controlled loads, using price and consumption forecasts, to minimise the payment and the discomfort. This is for a single consumer. 

Background: 
- needs for demand management and therefore better pricing. 
- better pricing exists and smart grid technologies exist to help consumers to make the best use of the better pricing, but not practical for consumers to seek optimal schedule themselves manually. 
- so automatica control method is required. 

Literature:
- agent-based approaches exist but have limitations. So appliance committment approach.  
- rarely discussed the comfort level (?) 
- gap: didn't tackle the prediction errors and did not consider user choice explicitly 

Models:
- loads: controllable thermal loads, controllable non-thermal loads and noncontrollable loads. 
    * Noncontrollable: predict with historical data
    * Controllable non-thermal loads: straightforward to schedule in the appliance commitment problem (?)
    * Controllable thermal loads: storage capacities, thermal dynamics, random consumption and consumer comfort
- objectives: electricity bills
- constraints: 
    * comfort constraints (just the bounds), 
    * the thermal dynamic constraints (didn't even present the formula) and 
    * the demand satisfaction constriant
- thermal load model: differential equations to describe the thermal dynamic behaviours. I have no ideas what they are

Methods:
- forecasting: price forecast and thermal demand forecast 
- two steps
    1. day ahead scheduling with forecast 
        a) forecast demand and price 
        b) estimate the on time for the thermal loads
        c) sort time slots based on their prices and find the maximum price level that the thermal will be turned on (the trigger price? like the demand threshold in DCM?)
        d) an optimisation based scheduling process. not sure if it is optimal... maybe not...
    2. real-time adjustment with updated information
        * I think it is like MPC

Results:
- over 20\% cost savings

Take-aways:
- THOUGHT, that one additional constraint and the MPC like process addresses the issues... 
- The model is interesting to me but I think that may be something standard in engineering.},

  abstract   = {Demand response is an important part of the smart grid technologies. This is a particularly interesting problem with the availability of dynamic energy pricing models. Electricity consumers are encouraged to consume electricity more prudently in order to minimize their electric bill, which is in turn calculated based on dynamic energy prices. In this paper, task scheduling policies that help consumers minimize their electrical energy cost by setting the time of use (TOU) of energy in the facility. Moreover, the utility companies can reasonably expect that their customers reduce their consumption at critical times in response to higher energy prices during those times. These policies target two different scenarios: (i) scheduling with a TOU-dependent energy pricing function subject to a constraint on total power consumption; and (ii) scheduling with a TOU and total power consumption-dependent pricing function for electricity consumption. Exact solutions (based on Branch and Bound) are presented for these task scheduling problems. In addition, a rank-based heuristic and a force directed-based heuristic are presented to efficiently solve the aforesaid problems. The proposed heuristic solutions are demonstrated to have very high quality and competitive performance compared to the exact solutions. Moreover, ability of demand shaping utilizing the aforementioned pricing schemes is demonstrated by the simulation results.},
  comment    = {This paper manages the tasks for multiple consumers/facilities. It develops TOU-dependent energy pricing

Background: 
- demand vary drastically, supply has to match the demand. 
- millions of dollars in the US alone must be invested to build new power plants for the next 20 years (has references). 
- shift load can optimise the overall cost.
-  demand shaping: shape demand profile to minimse bills

Literature:
- distributed stochastic consumption scheduling algorithms
- optimal algorithm, aggregate utility
- gap: existing work does not consider TOU and total power consumption dependent energy pricing function with a hard bound on the instantaneous power consumption, preferred start times for tasks and ignore the inconvenience cost (not entirely true... ). 
- [7] treates the power consumption limit a soft constraint (interesting. I need to read "Minimizing the Electricity Bill ofCooperative Users under a Quasi-Dynamic Pricing Model" again) 

Solutions: 
- two different scheduling strategies considering user preferences and peak power constraints
- branch and bound algorithms
- proposed heuristics

Models:
- objectives: 
    * payment
    * inconvenience cost (when the task is scheduled outside the preferred timing window)
- consider residential/commercial/industrail facilities with one or more tenants, occupants or workers as one unified electricity bill
- task: 
    * earliest start time, 
    * latest end time, 
    * duration, 
    * non-interruptible, 
    * power dissipation profile (known), 
    * preferred start time, 
- constraints: 
    * total power consumption constraint (the limit may vary from facilitiy to facility and from time to time)
    * start time constraint

Challenges: 
- load synchronization (bulks of tasks are moved to cheap time slots, creating new peaks)  in 1)
- solution: maximum consumption limit for each consumer


Problem 1: Power-constrained load scheduling for TOU-dependent energy pricing function
power-constrainted, minimum cost scheduling with fixed prices

Features: 
- prices are annouced a day ahead and is not changed until the next day. 
- prices function is a function of the day rather than the total power consumption (so day ahead prices)
- price at each time slot is fixed

Methods: 
- Brand and bound based scheduling method
    * enumerates all possible solutions... 
    * pick a task according to the adopted branching strategy (pick a variable): the task that exhibits the largest cost increase
    * assign a time slot for the selected task (pick a value)
    * calculate the upper bound using an iterative rank-based scheduling algorithm, that doesnt guarantee to converge and produce a complete schgeduling solution
    * calculate the lower bound using the proposed greedy algorithm
    * iterate 
- the rank-based scheduling algorithm can be used to solve the complete problem???? 

Problem 2: Losd scheduling for TOU and power dependent energy pricing function
minimum-cost scheduling with power dependent variable prices 

Features: 
- price function is an increasing and step-wise functino of both the time and the total consumption. 
- price at each time slot varies with the power consumption 
- total power consumption constraint is relaxed

Challenges: 
- computational NP-hard

Methods:
- branch and bound-based scheduling
    * exponentailly
- force directed scheduling solution
    * overwhelming, not fully understand yet

Experiments - single:
- time: discrete, 24 one-hour slots. 
- task durations: integer multiples of one hour (impractical... ) at least one hour, on average four hours
- consumption: based on real appliances
- number of possible start times of the task: set arbitratily using a normal probability distribution
- task numbers: 5 - 40

Results - single:
- for problem 1: solutions from both methods are similar. on average, heuristic solutions are very close to the BB/optimal solutions
- for problem 2: on average, heuristic solutions are very close to the BB/optimal solutions. Even in the worst cases, they are still quite close. Though heuristicis are much faster. Though 0.076 s for 5 tasks and 0.104 for 10 tasks. 
- only show performance index but no actual reduction data

Experiments - multiple:
- 10 facilities with 100 in each
- mostly for testing various pricing structure. Using a step-wise pricing function performs better than using a linear pricing function and fixed prices (with or w/out a power limit)

Results - multiple:
- they use flatness value.... 

Take-aways:
- there are some unclear parts in the experiment session but overall i think it is a decent  paper
- using solvers can be faster than the heuristics...},

  abstract   = {Dynamic energy pricing is a promising development that addresses the concern of finding an environmentally friendly solution to meeting energy needs of customers while minimizing their electrical energy bill. In this paper, we mathematically formulate the electrical energy bill minimization problem for cooperative networked consumers who have a single energy bill, such as those working in a commercial/industrial building. The idea is to schedule user requests for appliance use at different times during a fixed interval based on dynamic energy prices during that interval. Two different methods are presented to minimize the energy cost of such users under non-interruptible or interruptible jobs. The methods relay on a quasi-dynamic pricing function for unit of energy consumed, which comprises of a base price and a penalty term. The methods minimize the energy cost of the users while meeting all the scheduling constraints and heeding the pricing function. The proposed methods result in significant savings in the energy bill under different usage pricing, and scheduling constraints.},
  comment    = {Background: references on why dynamic pricing is better. A white paper that recommends dynamic pricings. Ameren Illinois Utilitesi implemented Power Smart Pricing.

Pricing: TOU prices a day ahead + a penalty charge for consuming demand over a predefined threshold (similar to demand charge). 
Price function: both continuous representation and discrrete representation are used. One for one method. This part is pre-defined. 
Penalty function: second level cost. If the current demand is higher than the maximum demand in a backward time window. If the backward time window is small enough then this pricing scheme becomes higly dynamic. This part is dynamic or the maximum demand threshold can be pre-defined rather than calculated from the backward time window. 

Goal: minimize the total electricity cost of a collection of cooperative consumers who are billed together, like office buildings. 
Cooperative in a sense that the optimisation is centralised. 

Model: an appliance has different stages of the operation goes through (start mode, normal operation mode, sleep mode and finish mode). Durations are sequences are predefined. Only two power modes are used for simplicity. Interruptible and non-interruptible. 

Constraints: start and end time constraints. maximum power capacity constraints. If interruptible, then include a restart mode time interval for each task and the second fragment starts after the first fragment is finished plus the restart period. 

Algorithm: a SQP method or heuristic method for solving the optimisation problem without interruption as one big problem. THOUGHTS: I wonder if it can solve it quickly enough... 

THOUGHTS: I don't fully understand the algorithm. Some concepts, like bottom levels are used without explaining. It is hard for me to understand what it is saying for now. It is a centralized optimisatoin method. I cannot analyse how complicated the problem is using this penalty function. It is the first time I hear about this pricing design. That being said, the pricing scheme is very different from mine, which is okay for not comparing the techniques in this paper and mine. It is sufficient to just use this as part of the movitation of my research. How large is their back window is not explained. I assume the problem should be very difficult to solve because the price indeed depends on the demand and demand is optimised against the price.},

  abstract   = {Real-time electricity pricing models can potentially lead to economic and environmental advantages compared to the current common flat rates. In particular, they can provide end users with the opportunity to reduce their electricity expenditures by responding to pricing that varies with different times of the day. However, recent studies have revealed that the lack of knowledge among users about how to respond to time-varying prices as well as the lack of effective building automation systems are two major barriers for fully utilizing the potential benefits of real-time pricing tariffs. We tackle these problems by proposing an optimal and automatic residential energy consumption scheduling framework which attempts to achieve a desired trade-off between minimizing the electricity payment and minimizing the waiting time for the operation of each appliance in household in presence of a real-time pricing tariff combined with inclining block rates. Our design requires minimum effort from the users and is based on simple linear programming computations. Moreover, we argue that any residential load control strategy in real-time electricity pricing environments requires price prediction capabilities. This is particularly true if the utility companies provide price information only one or two hours ahead of time. By applying a simple and efficient weighted average price prediction filter to the actual hourly-based price values used by the Illinois Power Company from January 2007 to December 2009, we obtain the optimal choices of the coefficients for each day of the week to be used by the price predictor filter. Simulation results show that the combination of the proposed energy consumption scheduling design and the price predictor filter leads to significant reduction not only in users' payments but also in the resulting peak-to-average ratio in load demand for various load scenarios. Therefore, th- - e deployment of the proposed optimal energy consumption scheduling schemes is beneficial for both end users and utility companies.},
  comment    = {This research manages the appliances of multiple consumers to minimize both the cost and the waiting given real-time pricing tariff infused with inclining block rates. The prices are predicted in advanced. 
Issue: lack of knowledges of how other users respond to time-varying prices and automated systems

(prices - knowledge of how other useres response without giving away private details) 

Background: 
- research on understanding the economic advantages of RTP and the envrionmental implications of RTP
- responding to RTP prices manually is difficult, which stops people form realising the full benefits of using RTP

USEFUL TIPS: POINT OUT HOW THIS PAPER IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHERS

Models:
- objectives: minimize the payment and waiting time
- decisions: schedule appliances of multiple consumers
- appliances: 
    * consumption per time slot, 
    * beginning and end of a time interval, 
    * duration, 
    * maximum and minimum power level per appliance, 
- constraints: 
    * maximum total consumption per time lot (an hour)
- prices: two-step prices per hour. Steps and prices are different. 
- assumptions: prices are annouced X time steps ahead of time

USEFUL TIPS: EXPLAIN THE MEANING OF CAREFACTOR IN THE PROBLEM DESIGN

BENEFITS: 
- knowing the total demand in advance, helping them to make better decisions

Method: 
- centralised linear programming methods, 
- interior-point method if continue consumption levels CPLEX and 
- MOSEK if discrete consumption levels
- dont know which solver they used....

Experiments: 
- discrete and continuous consumption level. GOOD. DISCRETE CONSUMPTION LEVEL makes more sense. 
- Load synchronization. (adopting IBR helps with addressing this... )
- 10 - 25 tasks
- 

Results:
- average daily payment reduction: 25%

The decision-support tool optimizes energy services provision by enabling end users to first assign values to desired energy services, and then scheduling their available distributed energy resources (DER) to maximize net benefits. We chose particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve the corresponding optimization problem because of its straightforward implementation and demonstrated ability to generate near-optimal schedules within manageable computation times. We improve the basic formulation of cooperative PSO by introducing stochastic repulsion among the particles. The improved DER schedules are then used to investigate the potential consumer value added by coordinated DER scheduling. This is computed by comparing the end-user costs obtained with the enhanced algorithm simultaneously scheduling all DER, against the costs when each DER schedule is solved separately. This comparison enables the end users to determine whether their mix of energy service needs, available DER and electricity tariff arrangements might warrant solving the more complex coordinated scheduling problem, or instead, decomposing the problem into multiple simpler optimizations.},

  abstract   = {In this paper, we consider a smart power infrastructure, where several subscribers share a common energy source. Each subscriber is equipped with an energy consumption controller (ECC) unit as part of its smart meter. Each smart meter is connected to not only the power grid but also a communication infrastructure such as a local area network. This allows two-way communication among smart meters. Considering the importance of energy pricing as an essential tool to develop efficient demand side management strategies, we propose a novel real-time pricing algorithm for the future smart grid. We focus on the interactions between the smart meters and the energy provider through the exchange of control messages which contain subscribers' energy consumption and the real-time price information. First, we analytically model the subscribers' preferences and their energy consumption patterns in form of carefully selected utility functions based on concepts from microeconomics. Second, we propose a distributed algorithm which automatically manages the interactions among the ECC units at the smart meters and the energy provider. The algorithm finds the optimal energy consumption levels for each subscriber to maximize the aggregate utility of all subscribers in the system in a fair and efficient fashion. Finally, we show that the energy provider can encourage some desirable consumption patterns among the subscribers by means of the proposed real-time pricing interactions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed distributed algorithm can potentially benefit both subscribers and the energy provider.},

Background:
- need to increase the grid efficiency:
	* increased expectations of customers, both in quality and quantity
	* limited energy resources
	* lengthy and expensive process of exploiting new resources
- demand management
	* voluntary 
	* direct load control
	* smart pricing
		= peak load pricing
		= adaptive pricing
- contributions:
	* a RTP algorithm  to keep the total consumption level below the power generation capacity
	* iterative communication betwen users and the utility
	* model the user's preferences and their energy consumption patterns using utility functions baed on concpets from microeconomics
	* formulate the utility maximisation problem and include constraints to limit the total energy consumption level of all users to the total generation capacity


Model:
- timeslot: hourly
- each user:
	* min and max power consumption
	* utility function to model the behaviour of differetn users
		= users choose their own  utlity functions
		= non-decreasing and concave, e.g. quadratic
		= the level of satisfaction obtained from consuming power
	* welfare = utility - cost
		= receive prices from the utility
- utility: 
	* min capacity to cover the min power requirements of all users
	* cost function
		= strictly convex and increasing, e.g. piece-wise linear functions and quadratic functions


Problem: 
- indivual optimal != socially optimal, therefore align the individual optimal consumption levels through the social optimal cse
- goal: maximise the aggregate utility of all consumers and minimise the cost imposed to the utility 
- coupling constraints for all users: the limited avaiable generation capacity (max demand for all) 
- decision variables: the actual demand level per time slot for each user


Algorithm:
- centralised solvling: IPM, not practical to know the utility functions of all users
- distributed, dual decomposition:
	* add the coupling constraints to the objective function using the Lagrange multiplier
	* decompose the dual aproblem
	* they show strong duality, so the dual solution is the primal solution
- utility at each iteration:
	* charges users with the dual multiplier as the artificial prices
	* update the dual multiplier using the gradient projection method 
		= involve a step size
- user at each iteratoin:
	* solve its local welfare maximisation problem to get the optimal consumption levels


Experiments: 
- 10 consumers
- 24 time slots per day. 
- maximum capactiy constraint == the maximum consumption requirements of all devices. 
- the utility parameter selected randomly. (I wonder how people will choose that parameter practically or sensibly. )


Thoughts:
- indivual optimal != socially optimal (add this to my thesis)},

In conventional studies, energy consumption is optimized from the perspective of each individual user without considering the interactions with each other. Here, the interaction among S.E. Hubs in IDSM program is formulated as a noncooperative game. The existence and uniqueness of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) is proved. Additionally, the strategies for each S.E. Hub are determined by proposing a distributed algorithm. We also address the IDSM game in a cloud computing (CC) framework to achieve efficient data processing and information management. Simulations are performed on a grid consisting of ten S.E. Hubs. We compare the CC framework with conventional data processing techniques to evaluate the efficiency of our proposed approach in determining NE. It is also shown that in the NE, the energy cost for each S.E. Hub and the peak-to-average ratio of the electricity demand decrease substantially.},

  abstract = {Demand-side management (DSM) is a key solution for reducing the peak-time power consumption in smart grids. To provide incentives for consumers to shift their consumption to off-peak times, the utility company charges consumers the differential pricing for using power at different times of the day. Consumers take into account these differential prices when deciding when and how much power to consume daily. Importantly, while consumers enjoy lower billing costs when shifting their power usage to off-peak times, they also incur discomfort costs due to the altering of their power consumption patterns. Existing works propose stationary strategies for the myopic consumers to minimize their short-term billing and discomfort costs. In contrast, we model the interaction emerging among self-interested and foresighted consumers as a repeated energy scheduling game and prove that the stationary strategies are suboptimal in terms of long-term total billing and discomfort costs. Subsequently, we propose a novel framework for determining optimal nonstationary DSM strategies, in which consumers can choose different daily power consumption patterns depending on their preferences, routines, and needs. As a direct consequence of the nonstationary DSM policy, different subsets of consumers are allowed to use power in peak times at a low price. The subset of consumers that are selected daily to have their joint discomfort and billing costs minimized is determined based on the consumers power consumption preferences as well as on the past history of which consumers have shifted their usage previously. Importantly, we show that the proposed strategies are incentive compatible. Simulations confirm that, given the same peak-to-average ratio, the proposed strategy can reduce the total cost (billing and discomfort costs) by up to 50\% compared to existing DSM strategies.},
  comment  = {Background:
- two ways to implement DSM: direct load control and smart pricing
- recent works jointly minimise discomfort costs and billing costs
	* price-taking: single or multiple (static distributed optimisation problems) 
	* price-anticipating: game theory (Nash equilibrium) 


Definitions: 
- price-taking consumers (do not consider the impacts of their consumption on others): 
	* single soresighted household problem: a stochastic control problem to minimise its long term total cost
	* multiple myopic household problem: a static optimisation problem to minimise the current total cost among cooperative consumers for which distributed algorithsm are used to find the optimal solution (distributed with coordinator?) 
- myopic and price-anticipating (know how their consumption affects the prices)
	* interactions among myopic consumers and care about nash equilibrium


This paper: 
- foresighted consumers repeatedly interact with each other


Gap:
- the optimal solution of their methods outperform the optimal solution of myopic pricing-taking consumers
	* the optimal solution to multiple myopic households are stationary which is suboptimal in long-term
	* achieve fairness among different subsets of consumers


Contribution:
- an optimal nonstationary DSM mechnism that minimise the total cost 
	* outform the stationary DSM strategy
- each day the DSM strategy selects an active set of consumers based on their preferences on whether or when to shift and the past consumption pattern shifts. Those consumers get lower future bills .


Model:
- one utility + multiple consumers
- time is divided into periods which are further divided into time slots
	* period: stage of interaction
	* time slot: for scheduling
- action for each consumer at each period: 
	* the consumption per time slot in that period
	* shiftable (deferrable and power flexible/thermal) and non-shiftable loads
- preference: prefered daily consumption pattern per consumer (same each day)
- pricing: CPP (defines peak days in a year or peak times in a day and charges higher prices during those peak hours if CPP events occur)
	* a peak price if the demand is above a threshold
	* off peak price if the demand is lower that threshold
- objective: billing + discomfort costs (for alterning consumption patterns)
	* discomfort cost at a period for a consumer: an linearly increasing function of the distance between the rescheduled and the desired consumption patterns
	* the distance is the absolute distance multiplied by a willingness factor (like our care factor) plus a how-to-shift factor


One-slot energy scheduling game:
- involves consumers, consumers' actions and consumers' cost functions
- at each time period: 
	* consumer determines its consumption pattern at this period based on its history (all of its past consumption patterns and the past prices up to the current time period)
	* the public hostiroy is the past prices up to the current period
	* the public strategy of a consumer is a mapping from  public history to current action
	* according to realisation equivalence principle, they claim that consumers lose nothing by restricting to public strategies, compared to strategies using the entire history. (alright....)
- average long-term cost is the cost function discounted by a factor "delta", representing how consumers discount their monetary costs in the future, due to interest rates/inflaction. 
	* C_i(pie) = (1- delta) sum(t -> infinite) (theta^t * c_i(pie (eta^t)))
	* eta^t: public history up to t
	* pie (eta*t): strategy profiles of all consumers
	* c_i (pie (eta*t)): the cost of consumer i in period t given all consumers' strategies
	* delta^t * c_i (pie (eta*t)): discount cost of consumer i in period t (?)
	* (1 - delta): ?????


Repeated enery scheduling game:
- involves consumers, the public histories and the repeated game cost functions (the average long-term cost discounted by a factor)


DSM mechanism Design Problem (DDP) formulation
- goal of a utility:
	* minimise the total cost (maximise the social welfare)
	* maintain fairness among all consumers
	* ensure the average discomfort cost of a consumer is less than a maximum value
- the utility solves the central problem and recommends the best strategies to all consumers ?????
- a period can be a week and the time slot can a day? 
- the utility solves this problem to recommend consumers the optimal solutions
- given the Pareto-optimal region, the DDP can be reformulated as a linear programming problem (solved by solvers?)


Non-stationary DSM algorithm (???)
- for period t:
	* if CPP event triggers, then recommend actions to all consumers
	* otherwise:
		= find the active set of consumers who have the largest indices
		= recommend actions to them
		= observe consumers actual response
		= if all follow, then update something and broadcast something
		= otherwise broadcast something else......

DSM implementation
- two phases: initialisation and run time phase
- initialisation:
	* the utiility broadcasts the CPP prices: off peak price, peak price and the triggering threshold
	* each consumer calculates its lowest possible costs (w and w/o considering the discomfort cost), and send them to the utility
	* the utility calculates the target cost vector by solving the DDP problem and sends the target cost vector to all consumers
- run time:
	* the DSM center calculates the set of consumers that will reschedule and send the recomended strategies to them
	* each of those consumers choose their consumption strategy (hopefully the recommended one)
	* the consumption patterns are then reported to the DSM center
	* the utility calculates the prices based on the total load and then broadcasts the prices. 
	* go to the next periods and repeat the run time process
(so it is like a centralised method? a mixed? weird.....)
- turn-taking scenarios are used to coordinate the scheduling updates among users


Experiments:
- pricing data: California pricing pilot program data
- 24 time slots in one period
- cost function: quadratic


Thoughts:
- this paper is absolutely painful to read. so many weird names and the writing...
- this is not interactive game?? but coordinated game??
- solving in centraslied manner but communicate in a distributed manner
- no detailed modelling on the appliance level. only the consumption pattern? doesn't care about the appliance level. Assume it can be done in some way.},

The two-way energy and information flows in a smart gird, together with the smart devices, bring about new perspectives to energy management. This paper investigates a distributed online algorithm for electricity distribution in a smart grid environment. We first present a formulation that captures the key design factors such as user's utility, grid load smoothing, and energy provisioning cost. The problem is shown to be convex and can be solved with a centralized online algorithm that only requires present information about users and the grid in our prior work. In this paper, we develop a distributed online algorithm that decomposes and solves the online problem in a distributed manner, and prove that the distributed online solution is asymptotically optimal. The proposed distributed online algorithm is also practical and mitigates the user privacy issue by not sharing user utility functions. It is evaluated with trace-driven simulations and shown to outperform a benchmark scheme.},

  abstract   = {Traditionally, economic dispatch and demand response (DR) are considered separately, or implemented sequentially, which may degrade the energy efficiency of the power grids. One important goal of optimal energy management (OEM) is to maximize the social welfare through the coordination of the suppliers' generations and customers' demands. Thus, it is desirable to consider the interactive operation of economic dispatch and DR, and solve them in an integrated way. This paper proposes a fully distributed online OEM solution for smart grids. The proposed solution considers the economic dispatch of conventional generators, DR of users, and operating conditions of renewable generators all together. The proposed distributed solution is developed based on a market-based self-interests motivation model since this model can realize the global social welfare maximization among system participants. The proposed solution can be implemented with multiagent system with each system participant assigned with an energy management agent. Based on the designed distributed algorithms for price updating and supply-demand mismatch discovery, the OEM among agents can be achieved in a distributed way. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.},
  comment    = {Abstract: goal, max social welfare, consider coordinating the supply and demand
Multiagent systems

Background: traditionally, economic dispatch and demand response are implemented separately. Currenlty, DR applications follow repdefined load curves or price patterns (meaning?) However, changing the load shapes will change the prices, which will also change the loads. Existing methods are mostly centralised and at a large timescale, which is slow to respond to changes (having to collect all information). Distributed approaches have been proposed, but a central controller is required. Or a paper considers distributed method without a central controller but didn't combine the economic dispatch with demand response. 

Model

controllable and must-run loads, each user has a demand bound
each generator has a generation bound

max social welfare model:
minimise the total production for the utlity, cost function is quadratic
maximise the aggregate utility, the utility is calculated for each user, quadratic

market-based self interest model
utility maximise the profits (earnings: selling price * produced units - production cost)
user maximi utility (utlity minus payment: bidding prices * purchased units)
optimal occurs when the gradient is zero
the price can be understood as the market clearning prices

two models actually have the same optimal solution

Ignore appliance levels. Assuming aggregate load profiles. Continuous not discrete.

Method:
price update algorithm 
need to discover supply-demand mismatch
require agents to communicate with their neigbours only using the power lines
it is like update the prices, then look at the gradient of the lagrange function with respect to lumda (the mistmatch), then update the prices
the prices are updated using a formulat that use the gradient or the mismatch and a step size kind of thing (a weight associate two agents), the weight is non-zero between neighouring agents and zero between non-neighoubours

This seems very interesting.

Background: 
- load management, reduce the peak demand. 
- Smart appliances are desgiend to achieve this goal. The utility company can use them to perform a higher degree of load management. 

Challenge: 
- when scheduling hundreds and millions, very careful, otherwise load synchronization. 
- centralised schedulig can aovoid this problem but not practical and does not preserve privacy. 

Lit review: 
- dynamic pricing has values but can cause load sync. 
- ultimately, the utility cares about the aggregate loads and using dynamic pricing is one method. 
- gap: this research does not use the dynamic pricing but focus on scheduling appliances to mat the ideal l shiftable load. 

Proposed method: 
- distributed, schedulign is done at the household or building level, only an ideal load curve from the utility is needed. 
	* main ideal: curve-fit the ideal load curve
	* no pricing signals needed
	* ideal shiftable load can be calculated from a ideal aggregate load profile and forecasted non-shiftable load profile.
- advantage of the method: efficient for very large networks
- load: shiftable and non-shiftable. 

Procedure: 
- the utility tells the ideal shiftable load to all households.
- households calculate a probability distribution based on the hypothetical tasks that will be scheduled in a day
- an appliance tells the smart meter that it needs to work (a request). 
- the smart meter returns a start time by samping from the calculated probability distribution

Model: 
- shiftable load and non-shiftable
- each shiftable appliance has:
	* a time window (earliest and latest), 
	* energy load profile

Comparison: 
1) baseline: a centralised controller with perfect knowledge of all requests, but SCALABILITY issue, but they use the request types instead of each individual request. so much more scalable because much less request types than individual requests. minimise the ideal shiftable load and the actual load profile
2) randomised control: same ideal shiftable load sent to all consumers

Experiments: 
- the results of three methods are similar, which one is better depends on the load shapes and the time windows of the requests
- I cannot understand why the optimal with perfect knowledge is not the best while it looks like it is the best. 

(they require the utility to send the ideal load curve to households. households use that to calculate a probability distribution for each task but only a probablity for each time in the time window. scheduling is done through sampling from the probability distribution. the main idea is the curve-fit the ideal load curve so the actual load curve is close to the ideal one. when thousands and millions of tasks are scheduled using the randomised control method, the resulting actual aggregate load profile will approximate the ideal one to a great extent. ) --

To do:
- I can try calculating the diff in the exp. 

THOUGHTS
- INTERESTING PAPER. NOT CONSIDERING RTP IS DIFFERENT ALREADY. AND NOT CONSIDERING COST, PREFERENCES OR ANYTHING. 
- TO ACHIEVE THAT IDEAL LOAD, WHICH MAY ALREADY REDUCE THE COST. - SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE I THINK.},

  abstract   = {Demand side management will be a key component of future smart grid that can help reduce peak load and adapt elastic demand to fluctuating generations. In this paper, we consider households that operate different appliances including PHEVs and batteries and propose a demand response approach based on utility maximization. Each appliance provides a certain benefit depending on the pattern or volume of power it consumes. Each household wishes to optimally schedule its power consumption so as to maximize its individual net benefit subject to various consumption and power flow constraints. We show that there exist time-varying prices that can align individual optimality with social optimality, i.e., under such prices, when the households selfishly optimize their own benefits, they automatically also maximize the social welfare. The utility company can thus use dynamic pricing to coordinate demand responses to the benefit of the overall system. We propose a distributed algorithm for the utility company and the customers to jointly compute this optimal prices and demand schedules. Finally, we present simulation results that illustrate several interesting properties of the proposed scheme.},
  comment    = {This research computes the optimal prices to maximise the individual net benefits and the social welfare with a distributed algorithm. It manages various types of loads of multiple consumers. 

Background: 
- DSM, reduce peak load and adapt demand to supply
- Aim: 
	* when consumers selfishly optimise their own benefits, they automatically maximise the social welfare 
	* Appliances are indirectly coordinated by RTP


Model:
- time: discrete
- utiltiy:
	* the design of the retail prices is an intersting subject that is beyond the scope of this paper. For simplicity, they make the important assumption that this design can summarised by a cost function C(Q, t) that specifies the cost for the utility company to provide Q amount of power to the N customers at time t. 
	* the modelling of cost function is an active research issue. Here they assume that the cost function C(Q, t) is convex increasing in Q for each t. 
	* objective: maximise the social welfare
- customers: an appliance has:
	* a utility function that quantifies the utility user i obtains when it consumes power at each time t
	* a set of linear inequalities on the vector power
- storage:
	* capacity
	* energy level at time t
	* power
	* assume that power leakage is negligible
	* maximum charge/discharge rate
	* minimum energy level at the end of control horizon
	* battery cost (purchase and maintenance which depends on how fast/much/often it is charged), assumed to be a convex function of the vector charge/discharge


Algorithm:
- centralised, impractical
- setting the prices to be the marginal cost of power is optimal
- procedure: at ecah iteration
	* utility collects forecasts of demand profiels from all customers over a communication network. Set the prices to the marginal cost and broadcasts the prices to all customers over the network
	* each customer updates its demand profile and charging schedule (separately) after receiving the prices
- gradient algorithm. It will converge when the step size is small enough 
(thought: 2016Mhaxx paper can show that gradient only takes a long time and lots of iterations. ) 


Detailed appliance models:
- type 1: AC or fridge that controls the temperature of the envrionment
	* inside and outside temp
	* comfortable temp
	* time slots when the temperature comfort is desired e.g. when they are home
	* a linear dynamics that depicts how the inside temp evolves
	* concave and continously differentiable utility function
	* maximum allowed power
- type 2: shiftables that must be completed before a certain time
	* set of times that the task can work/charge
	* min and max power
	* min and max total cosnumption required
	* concave and continously differentiable utility function
- type 3: must run
	* concave and continously differentiable utility function
- type 4: for entertainment 
	* min and max power 
	* min and max total power required
	* set of times that they are needed
	* utility ? 


Experiment:
- up to 24 households: two types
	* 6 appliances each: AC, PHEW, washer, lighting, entertainment, battery
	* always have people at home
	* no one at home from 8am - 6pm
- a day starts at 8am
- supply: a smooth piecewise quadratic function as the cost function
	* a quadratic function per demand level. 
	* can have m demand levels


THOUGHTS:
they did not explain how they incorporate the constraints.

  abstract   = {Most of the existing demand-side management programs focus primarily on the interactions between a utility company and its customers/users. In this paper, we present an autonomous and distributed demand-side energy management system among users that takes advantage of a two-way digital communication infrastructure which is envisioned in the future smart grid. We use game theory and formulate an energy consumption scheduling game, where the players are the users and their strategies are the daily schedules of their household appliances and loads. It is assumed that the utility company can adopt adequate pricing tariffs that differentiate the energy usage in time and level. We show that for a common scenario, with a single utility company serving multiple customers, the global optimal performance in terms of minimizing the energy costs is achieved at the Nash equilibrium of the formulated energy consumption scheduling game. The proposed distributed demand-side energy management strategy requires each user to simply apply its best response strategy to the current total load and tariffs in the power distribution system. The users can maintain privacy and do not need to reveal the details on their energy consumption schedules to other users. We also show that users will have the incentives to participate in the energy consumption scheduling game and subscribing to such services. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach can reduce the peak-to-average ratio of the total energy demand, the total energy costs, as well as each user's individual daily electricity charges.},
  comment    = {This research focues on the interactions between consumers, rather than the interactions between consumers and a utility. This research works on the energy consumption scheduling for multiple consumers. Focusing on scheudling individual houses is not sufficent. Multiple houses must be considered to drive the aggregate load to satisfy some desired properties. 

Background
- direct load control: user privacy, major concern and a barrier in implementating DLC programs
- alternative: smart pricing, TOU, CPP and RTP
- RTP: adopted in North USA, 
	* difficult and confusing for consumers to manually respond to prices
	* load synchronisation
- Existing work focus on interactions between the utility and consumers
	* they argue that these methods may not alwasy achieve the best solution (why?)


This work
- an incentive-based energy consumption scheduling scheme
- an energy source + several consumers
- they believe through an appropriate pricing scheme, the NE of the consumption game among consumers is the optimal solution of the system-wide optimisation problem
- minimise cost and PAR in the total load
- investigate the impact of changes in the number of appliances to energy consumption scheduling

Model
- all households are connected through a local area network LAN (suits small community I believe)
	* a set of consumers N
	* total load per hour for each consumer: l^h_n
	* total load per hour of all consumers: L_h
	* daily peak load level: L_peak
	* daily average load level: L_avg
- shiftable, power flexiable and must run
	* EST and LFT
	* demand profile
	* min and max demand level
	* decision: consumption scheduleing vector
	* pre-determined total daily energy consumpion per appliance (fixed not changed)	
- time slot: hourly
- energy cost of all: C_h(L_h)
	* this function can vary at different times of the day
	* increasing and strictly convex
	* quadratic cost function
	* can be the actual enerfy cost or simply artificial cost tarrifss which are used by utility to impose a proper load control
	* British Columbia Hydro in Canada uses a convex price model inform of a two-step piecewise linear function
- energy cost per household
	* a percentage of the total cost, so  each household needs others' demand profiles to calculate the total cost


Problem formulation
- PAR minimisation 
	* can be formulated as a linear program 
	* solved by simplex or interior point method
- Cost minimisation
	* convex
	* solved by IPM

Energy consumption game
- goal: 
	1) min amount of info exchanges among consumers and the energy source, 
	2) let each household schedules according to individual needs, and 
	3) make sure each consumer has an incentive to use the feature and follow the schedule
- they show that achieving cost minimisation also achieves a low PAR (IMPORTANT. I WILL CITE THIS)
- pricing: 
	* the price should reflect the consumers' total daily energy consumption and relate it to the total energy cost of the system
	* consumers are charged proportional to their total daily energy consumption
	* the exact amount depends on the cost of energy at each hour of the day and this cost is a strictly conve function
- game model:
	* players: consumers
	* strategies: energy consumption scheduling vector to maximise payoffs
	* payoffs: the cost calculated based on ALL scheduling vectors
- theorems:
	* NE exists because of the convex and strictly increasing cost function
	* NE is when no consumer would benefit by deviating from scheduling
	* NE is the optimal solution of the cost minimisation problem
	* the proportional charging gives the incentive to no cheating -- no one will benefit more from cheating


Distributed Algorithm
- an algorithm to reach the NE
	* strategy-proof
	* convergence proof
	* optimality proof
- algorithm
	* initial: all consumers choose a schedule and broad the demand profile
	* every consumer solves the cost minimisation problem using IPM given others' demand profile
	* if the new schedule is different, then use the new schedule and broadcast the load profile to all other consumers
	* if receive a new load profile, then update the knowledge of others
	* repeat until no new load profile is received
- notes:
	* updates are asynchronous, meaning no two consumers update their scheduling vectors at the same time. 	
	* each consumer updates its scheduling vector sequentially! (the energy source can decide the timing when each consumer updates its schedule, or other turntaking scenarios can be used)
	* their proportional billing system makes it strategy-proof
	* some heuristic algorithms can be used for choosing the sequence


Experiment
- consumers: 10, each has
	* 10-20 non-shiftable/must-run appliances
	* 10-20 shiftable appliances
- quadratic cost function
- PAR reduction: 17% less 
- cost reduction: 18% less 
- converged after 22 iterations in total, 2 iterations per user
- they plotted the PAR in each consumer's load and compared it with the PAR in the aggregate load across all consumers
	* aggregate PAR is significnatly less than individual PARs
- the PAR achieved by cost minimisation is very close to that of PAR minimisation while cost minimisation significantly reduces the cost
	* 32/50 scenarios, the PAR values are the same
	* on average, only 0.05% off improvement in the PAR reduction in PAR minimisation scenarios
	* cost minimisation can significantly reduce PAR in the aggregate load
- they varied the percentage of shiftable load from 10% to 90%
	* when 90%, the PAR can reduce to only 1.35, indicating almost a flat load


Thoughts
- they demonstrate the relationship between cost minimisation and par minisation
- this work needs others' demand profiles to calculate the total cost and their own costs. while in Fionando's work they need others' demand profile to calculate the peak demand},

At the same time, energy demand is rapidly increasing, putting the world on the verge of a global energy crisis. Moreover, the extensive use of conventional energy sources is polluting the environment and causing global warming. On the other hand, wind and other renewable energy sources are viable and clean alternatives to fossil fuels. Low operating cost and extensive availability make wind one of the most advantageous and effective renewable energy sources. This paper provides an exposure to the necessity for deployment of renewable energy sources and the worldwide installed capacity of wind power as well as a review of various wind technologies in conjunction with their applications and devices of operation. Furthermore, this paper discusses the cost of electric generation in wind power plants as well as the economic and environmental policies that advocate the installation of wind energy systems.},

The relatively low utilisation of generation and networks (of about 50%) means that there is significant scope for \{DSM\} to contribute to increasing the efficiency of the system investment. The importance of the diversity of electricity load is discussed and the negative effects of \{DSM\} on load diversity illustrated. Ageing assets, the growth in renewable and other low-carbon generation technologies and advances in information and communication technologies are identified as major additional drivers that could lead to wider applications of \{DSM\} in the medium term. Potential benefits of \{DSM\} are discussed in the context of generation and of transmission and distribution networks. The provision of back-up capacity by generation may not be efficient as it will be needed relatively infrequently, and \{DSM\} may be better placed to support security. We also present an analysis of the value of \{DSM\} in balancing generation and demand in a future \{UK\} electricity system with significant variable renewable generation. We give a number of reasons for the relatively slow uptake of DSM, particularly in the residential, commercial and small business sectors. They include a lack of metering, information and communication infrastructure, lack of understanding of the benefits of DSM, problems with the competitiveness of \{DSM\} when compared with traditional approaches, an increase in the complexity of system operation and inappropriate market incentives.},

The context for load control is established by providing an overview of system control objectives, including economic dispatch, automatic generation control, and spinning reserve. The paper then reviews existing initiatives that seek to develop load control programs for the provision of power system services. We then discuss some of the challenges to achieving a load control scheme that balances device-level objectives with power system-level objectives. One of the central premises of the paper is that, in order to achieve full responsiveness, direct load control (as opposed to price response) is required to enable fast time scale, predictable control opportunities, especially for the provision of ancillary services such as regulation and contingency reserves. Centralized, hierarchical, and distributed control architectures are discussed along with benefits and disadvantages, especially in relation to integration with the legacy power system control architecture. Implications for the supporting communications infrastructure are also considered. Fully responsive load control is illustrated in the context of thermostatically controlled loads and plug-in electric vehicles.},

Demand response (DR), by promoting the interaction and responsiveness of the customers, may offer a broad range of potential benefits on system operation and expansion and on market efficiency.

In this paper a survey of \{DR\} potentials and benefits in smart grids is presented.

  abstract = {Abstract Demand for flexibility in electricity systems and the transition to the Smart Grid is increasing opportunities for demand response (DR). However, there are many barriers which prevent the full potential of \{DR\} being realised. Unlocking of this potential, through identification of \{DR\} enablers, can be aided through systematic classification and analysis of \{DR\} barriers. To this end, while previous works mostly focused on individual aspects, this paper develops a comprehensive ÔøΩsocio-techno-economicÔøΩ review, classification and analysis of \{DR\} barriers and enablers in a Smart Grid context. This provides an intellectual framework which may be used to underpin further work on the study and integration of DR. \{DR\} barriers are classified as either fundamental (i.e., relating to intrinsic human nature/essential enabling technology) or secondary (i.e., relating to anthropogenic institutions/or system feedbacks). Fundamental barriers are defined as economic, social or technological, whilst secondary barriers relate to political regulatory aspects, design of markets, physical (electrical network) issues, or to general understanding of DR. Subsequently, associated enablers for the defined barriers are suggested. Consideration of technical and commercial/social aspects for both power system and information and communication technology (the ÔøΩinternet of thingsÔøΩ) domains provides a foundational contribution to improve understanding of \{DR\} within the Smart Grid paradigm. Finally, the complexity resulting from connections between various barriers, enablers and the energy system generally, and the existence of the signature characteristics of complex systems is acknowledged and implications discussed.},

  abstract = {The smart grid concept continues to evolve and various methods have been developed to enhance the energy efficiency of the electricity infrastructure. Demand Response (DR) is considered as the most cost-effective and reliable solution for the smoothing of the demand curve, when the system is under stress. DR refers to a procedure that is applied to motivate changes in the customers' power consumption habits, in response to incentives regarding the electricity prices. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of various DR schemes and programs, based on the motivations offered to the consumers to participate in the program. We classify the proposed DR schemes according to their control mechanism, to the motivations offered to reduce the power consumption and to the DR decision variable. We also present various optimization models for the optimal control of the DR strategies that have been proposed so far. These models are also categorized, based on the target of the optimization procedure. The key aspects that should be considered in the optimization problem are the system's constraints and the computational complexity of the applied optimization algorithm.},

Developments in the theory of computational complexity allow us to establish the theoretical complexity of a variety of stochastic programming problems studied in this literature. Under the assumption that the stochastic parameters are independently distributed, we show that two-stage stochastic programming problems are #P-hard. Under the same assumption we show that certain multi-stage stochastic programming problems are PSPACE-hard. The problems we consider are non-standard in that distributions of stochastic parameters in later stages depend on decisions made in earlier stages.},

  comment   = {- Introduction

Gradient methods belong to a class of search methods for real-valued functions on R^n. These methods use the gradient of the given function. 

The gradient acts in such a direction that for a given small displacement, the function f increases more in the direction of the gradient than in any other direction. The direction in which -reverse_triangle f(x) is the direction of maximum rate of decrease of f at x. Hence, the direction of negative gradient is a good direction to search if we want to find a function minimiser. 

The gradient varies as the search proceeds, tending to zero as we approach the minimser. We have the option of taking very small steps and re-evaluating the gradient at every step, or we take large steps each time. The first approach results in a laborious method of reaching the minimiser, whereas the second approach may result in a more zigzag path to the minimser. The advantage of the second approach is a possibly fewer numer of the gradient evalutions. 

Gradient methods are simple to implement and often perform well. For this reason, they are widely used in practical applications. 

- The method of steepest descent

This is a gradient algorithm where the step size alpha_k is chosen to achieve the maximum amount of decrease of the objective function at each individual step (like exact line search). 

- Analysis of gradient methods

* convergence
The method of steepest descent is an example of an iterative algorithm. This means the algorithm generates a sequence of points, each calculated on the basis of the points preceding it. The method is a descent method becasue as each new point is generated by the algorithm, the corresponding value of the objective function decreases in value (i.e., the algorithm possesses the descent property). 

We say that an iterative algorithm is globally convergent if for any arbitrary starting point the algorithm is guaranteed to generate a sequence of points converging to a point that satisfies the FONC for a minimiser. When the algorithm is not globally convergent, it may still generate a sequence that converges to a point satisfying the FONC, the provided the initial point is sufficiently close to the point. In this case, we say that the algorithm is locally convergent. 

the rate of convergence: how fast the algorithm converges to a solution point. the convergence of the algorithm depends on the choice of the step size and we would not expect the algorithm to work for arbitrary alpha.},

non-convex DR problem is decomposed. 

Background:
- scheduling large numbers of households is important and challenging
	1) conflicts interests of households and the utility:
		= households: minimise cost and maxmimise comfort
		= utlity: reduce the peak demand and minimise cost in the whoelsale market
	2) combinatorial structure of the problem:
		= devices have discrete operation points
		= some household device uses are coupled

Literature:
- mixed-integer variables that has a NP-hard computational complexity
	* solving it centrally is intractable for large numbers of households
- centrally: communication overhead and privacy concerns
-distributed:
	* continuous household energy level
	* mixed-integer household energy level and inter-temporal device couplings
- this paper:
	* non-convex problem, couplings between storages, appliances and distributed energy resources
	* a fast distributed grandient algorithm + a double smoothed dual function, designed to terminate in 60 iterations, can be ideal for online version
	* minimal parameter runing
	* demonostrates that a conventional gradient method fails to solve the problem 

Model:
- household devices:
	* demand profile and desired scheduling intervals
	* type 1: must-run
		= base load of a household
	* type 2: power flexible but time inflexible
		= operating modes and preferred operation mode
		= discrete power levels (for different modes) 
		= can incur dissatisfaction when on the desired mode
	* type 3: time flexible but non-interruptible 
		= total energy requirement per shceduling horizon
		= discrete power levels
		= preferred scheduling intervals
		= can incur dissatisfaction when outside those intervals
	* type 4: time flexible and interruptible with a continuous power level within a certain range
		= power ragne
		= e.g. EVs
	* type 5: time flexible and interruptible storage with a coninuous power level
	* type 6: thermostatically controlled devices
		= parameters defined by the geometry of the house or room, thermal properties of the house or room materials, and the thermostatically controlled device characteristics (temperature of air flow, air mass flow rate) 
		= comfortable temperature
		= e.g. AC
		= can incur dissatisfaction when not at the comfortable temperature
- household:
	* demand limit for a time slot (the coupling constraint) for satety capacity not but budgeting
- aggregator:
	* cost faced by an aggregator buying energy in the wholesale market: convex quadratic function
- objective: 
	* minimise total cost and total dissatisfaction
- coupling constraints:
	* power balance: what it draws from the grid is what it demands... (dont know why it is needed...)

Problem Fomulation
- mixed-integer quadratic program, NP-hard problem
	* centrally: communication overhead, privact issues
- Lagrangian relaxation: relax the coupling constraints
- decomplised, Lagrange dual, tho the concave dual function is typically nondifferentiable
- apply a doulbe smooting technique to accelerate convergence

Algorithm:
- phase 1: 
	* double smooth, 
	* run fast gradient method for a fixed number of iteration
	* get the vector of Lagrange multipliers, the smoothness parameter and the step size
- phase 2: 
	* used the resuling multipliers, parameter and the step size as a warm start for this phase
	* smooth once, drop the second smooth
	* add a penalty term to the single smoothed dual function
		= penalise large deviations of household agent i's total load at time-slot t from its value at the previous iteration
	* run for a fixed number of iterations irrespective of the size of the DR system

Experiments:
- hourly time slot
- up to 2560 households and each has up to 10 devices on average:
	* 40% have PV and batteries
	* no more than 60% have EVs
	* not more than 70% have AC
- implementation:
	* algorithm in MATLAB
	* model in AMPL
	* solver: Gurobi 6.0.5
	* machine: an Intel Core i7, 3.7GHz, 64-bit, 128G RAM computing platform
- centralised computation:
	* more than 3 days to solve 1280 and 250 households
- distributed computation:
	* a fast and smooth convergence in less than 60 iters
	* a pretty good solution in 25 iters
	* opt. gap (%): on average 0.32%

  comment    = {This research manages energy storage devices in residential homes, so they do no change at the same time but cooerpate together to save the most money. 

The issue is that without any interfere, people store electricity when they need and they may all charge batteries and the same time if the price is the same for everyone. If too much peak demand is reduced, then the actual price at off peak times may become more expensive than those at peak times, making using batteries more expensive. 

Gap: current research often study how individual homes can optimise their batteries or how batteries can be used to coordinate with renewable energy generators, however, they do not consider individual preferences of each home and do not model the reactions of individual homes. Thus, this research studies the dynamics where all homes are given the freedom to buy and sell at whenever they want. (what do the preferences mean? )

First attempt at modelling, predicting equilibria and building intelligent strategies for the problem of electricity sotrage on a large scale. 

Closely related to optimisation but not exactly. It is not about finding that optimal solution but converging to an equilibrian behaviour. 

Assumptions are that the price changes continuously with the demand. Consumers are rational. They PREDICT the prices a day ahead. They assume the market prices do not vary significantly and they use a simple method --- moving average to predict futre market prices. 

It means it does not allow everyone changes its battery storage profile to the optimum profile all at once. Some may just change partially an some do not change at all. The algorithm needs to find out what is the learning rate/the step size/what the partial rate for every one.},

  abstract = {The residential sector is currently one of the major contributors to the global energy balance. However, the energy demand of residential users has been so far largely uncontrollable and inelastic with respect to the power grid conditions. With the massive introduction of renewable energy sources and the large variations in energy flows, also the residential sector is required to provide some flexibility in energy use so as to contribute to the stability and efficiency of the electric system. To address this issue, demand management mechanisms can be used to optimally manage the energy resources of customers and their energy demand profiles. A very promising technique is represented by demand-side management (DSM), which consists in a proactive method aimed at making users energy-efficient in the long term. In this paper, we survey the most relevant studies on optimization methods for DSM of residential consumers. Specifically, we review the related literature according to three axes defining contrasting characteristics of the schemes proposed: DSM for individual users versus DSM for cooperative consumers, deterministic DSM versus stochastic DSM and day-ahead DSM versus real-time DSM. Based on this classification, we provide a big picture of the key features of different approaches and techniques and discuss future research directions.},

  abstract = {Over the last few years, the fast-growing energy needs across the world have intensified a central challenge: how to reduce the generation and operation costs in power systems and, in parallel, to minimize the hydrocarbon emissions. Moreover, one-quarter of world's population still lacks access to electricity, as the cost of building conventional power grids is not affordable by third world countries. On the other hand, behind-the-meter (BTM) energy systems offer cost-effective solutions to aforementioned challenges, as they enable end-users to satisfy their energy needs with distributed energy generation and storage technologies. To that end, this paper presents a detailed survey of BTM energy management systems. The paper starts with the classification of the electrical loads with respect to their physical properties, priority ranking, and sizes. Next, the literature on BTM energy management systems is systematically classified into three main categories: technology layer, economic layer, and social layer. The technology layer spans the studies related to power systems including distributed generation and storage technologies, whereas the economic layer shows how economic incentives along with optimization and scheduling techniques are employed to shape the energy consumption. The social layer, on the other hand, presents the recent studies on how to employ social sciences to reduce the energy consumption without requiring any technological upgrades. This paper also provides an overview of the enabling technologies and standards for communication, sensing, and monitoring purposes. In the final part, a case study is provided to illustrate an implementation of the system.},

  abstract = {The increasing demand for electricity and the emergence of smart grids have presented new opportunities for home energy management systems (HEMS) in demand response markets. HEMS are demand response tools that shift and curtail demand to improve the energy consumption and production profile of a dwelling on behalf of a consumer. HEMS usually create optimal consumption and production schedules by considering multiple objectives such as energy costs, environmental concerns, load profiles, and consumer comfort. The existing literature has presented several methods, such as mathematical optimization, model predictive control, and heuristic control, for creating efficient operation schedules and for making good consumption and production decisions. However, the effectiveness of the methods in the existing literature can be difficult to compare due to diversity in modelling parameters, such as appliance models, timing parameters, and objectives. The present paper provides a comparative analysis of the literature on HEMS, with a focus on modelling approaches and their impact on HEMS operations and outcomes. In particular, we discuss a set of HEMS challenges such as forecast uncertainty, modelling device heterogeneity, multi-objective scheduling, computational limitations, timing considerations, and modelling consumer well-being. The presented work is organized to allow a reader to understand and compare the important considerations, approaches, nomenclature, and results in prominent and new literary works without delving deeply into each one.},

Here, the utility is modeled as a function of time in order to represent the timeliness of loads. Based on the developed theory, we introduce a parametric utility model from which the price elastic behaviors of aggregated loads from a power system are established statistically as multi-dimensional demand-price functions. Finally, we investigate the problem of optimal real-time electricity prices under the framework of social welfare maximization. Considering demand elasticity from users, we show here that the optimal real-time electricity prices that maximize the social welfare of a power system will match the marginal costs of energy production at load levels resulting from these optimal electricity prices. The solution for this can be pre-calculated using a simple iterative algorithm without the need for excessive information exchange between users and the utility company. Theoretical results from this paper are validated through numerical examples using a simplified power network.},
  comment    = {This research studies the price elasticity of electrical demand? 

Background: benefits of DSM, reduced cost. Traditional DSM, DLC. New, price-based. 
How accuratethe designed pricing scheme models the customers' responsive behaviour to the prices. 

Gap: current methods calculate prices among users and the tulity, high vol of data traffic

Prices: annouced day-ahead or advance

Time: hourly slots

Task: all can be completed in one time slot. Long tasks will be decomposed into small one hour tasks. 
Types: critial, interruptible, deferrable

Objective:
consumers: marginal utility minus the price = welfare

Method: model the marginal utility function as a stochastic process
Then it jumps to the probability distribution of marginal utility function parameters, which can be obtained from surveys or statistical analysis. I am confused. 

Electricity cost funtion: quadratic 
BUT historical prices are known

  abstract   = {A demand response (DR) problem is considered entailing a set of devices/subscribers, whose operating conditions are modeled using mixed-integer constraints. Device operational periods and power consumption levels are optimized in response to dynamic pricing information to balance user satisfaction and energy cost. Renewable energy resources and energy storage systems are also incorporated. Since DR becomes more effective as the number of participants grows, scalability is ensured through a parallel distributed algorithm, in which a DR coordinator and DR subscribers solve individual subproblems, guided by certain coordination signals. As the problem scales, the recovered solution becomes near-optimal. Robustness to random variations in electricity price and renewable generation is effected through robust optimization techniques. Real-time extension is also discussed. Numerical tests validate the proposed approach.},
  comment    = {Abstract: this research manages multiple devices, optimises their consumption levels and the opreational periods, given MIP constraints. It considers uncertainties in elecricity prices and renewables.  

Background: dynamic pricing that varies with the total load and the time of day is the key to achieve desireable load profile and save costs. Solving large-scale DR problesm requies parallel and distributed algorithms. Privacy is an issue. 
Three types of loads: must-run, interruptible and non-interruptible. 
Gap: 
1) given or forecasted prices are subject to real-time adjustment or forecast errors, which is more an issue when considering renewables. 
2) previous work solves convex problems
Proposal: an optimisation framework for piece-wise linear pricing and renewable resources and allows real-time price ajudstment
Goal: optimality, SCALABILITY and robustness
Method: Lagrange relaxation method. When the number of DR devices increase, the solution is near optimal. Computing optimal soution needs too much computational power, therefore near-optimal is sufficient. The difficulties come in the coupling constraints. 

Objective: cost and utility

Consumer/devices model:
Each consumer has one DR device. Device has an utility function, power consumption profile. 
Must-run but power variable loads (AC) have min and max power levels, must run time window
Shiftable (interruptible or not): total consumption requirement, cannot be switched for non-interruptible. THE IF THE DEVICE IS NOT RUNNING THEN THE CONSUMPTION IS ZERO CONSTRAINT MAKE THE PROBLEM NONCONVEX. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY. I HAVE CONSTRAINT IN MY MODEL TOO. DOES IT MEAN IT IS ALSO NON-CONVEX. OR IT JUST NON-CONTINUOUS? I BELIEVE THE NON-CONVEX CONSTRAINTS CAN BE MODELLED DIFFERENTLY, WITHOUT IF-ELSE. 

Cost function: 
piece-wise linear, convex
max aggregate power constraint
the pricing method (step price) is the same as mine
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRICES ARE GIVEN BUT THE COST FUNCTION IS CONVEX. SO WHAT IS GIVEN? 

Renewables:
forecasted power outputs

Batteries:
charage and discharge profile, max and min charge rate, capacity, ideal efficiency (1), 

Decision variables:
what are they. I am confused. 
Consumption profile of each device? 

Assmption:
prices are given and can change in real-time
renewable outputs are predicted but also can be inaccurate
ME: JOINTLY COMPUTE THAT BEST PRICES, WHICH WILL LEAD TO THE OPTIMAL AGGREATE LOAD PROFILE

Robust optimisation: 
trade-off between robustness and optimality

Challenges:
coupling constraints, complextiy, not scalabe if centralised. 

Method:
dual, robust, quite complicated.
THEY ALSO CONSIDER THE PROBABILITY OF RUNNING A DEVICE AT EACH TIME AND MINIMISE THE EXPECTED TOTAL COST, so they are near-optimal. is mine also near-optimal? THEY ALSO HAVE PERCENTAGE IN EACH ITERATION AND SEND THEM TO THE DEVICES. 

Ideas:
it uses the iterative algorithms to calcuate the on/off status as a probabiltiy distribution. Once the on/off statuses are fixed, then solve the robust or the deterministic optimisation problem 
QUITE INTERESTING, THOUG I STILL DONT GET WHY ON/OFF STATUES NEED TO BE CALCULATED IN THIS WAY. 

THOUGHTS
MINE IS MUCH SIMPLER BUT I DO NOT HOW TO SAY WHY THEY ARE MOT COMPLICATED YET. CALCULATING THE DUAL IS COMPLICATED ENOUGH. THEY ADMIT THE COMPUTATIONL COMPLEXITY FOR THE AGGREGATOR COULD INCREASE. PERHAPS I WILL NEED TO VISIT THIS PAPER AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. 
THE PRICING AND THE ITERATION BITS ARE CONFUSING.

The proposed algorithm is distributed and cooperative such that it eliminates the need for a central energy-management unit, central price coordinator, or leader. The optimum energy solution is found through local peer-to-peer communications among smart devices. Each distributed generation unit is connected to a local price regulator, as is each consumer unit. In response to the price of energy proposed by the local price regulators, the power regulator on each generation/consumer unit determines the level of generation/consumption power needed to optimize the benefit of the device. The consensus-based coordination among price regulators drives the behavior of the overall system toward the global optimum, despite the greedy behavior of each unit. The primary advantages of the proposed approach are: 1) convergence to the global optimum without requiring a central controller/coordinator or leader, despite the greedy behavior at the individual level and limited communications; and 2) scalability in terms of per-node computation and communications burden.},

Multiobjective (MO) optimization is applied to the environmental/economic problem of the MG. The proposed problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained MO optimization problem. The model takes into consideration the operation and maintenance costs as well as the emissions NOx, SO2, and CO2 reduction. The MG considered in this paper consists of a wind turbine, a micro turbine , a diesel generator , a photovoltaic array , a fuel cell, and a battery storage. The optimization is aimed at minimizing the operating cost of the system while constraining it to meet the costumer demand and safety of the system. We also added a daily income and outgo from sold and purchased power. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach to satisfy the load and to reduce the cost and the emissions in one single run.},
  comment    = {This research manages several power generators in a microgrid, including a wind turbine, a micro turbine, a diesel generator, a PV  array, a fuel cell and a battery storage. The aim of this research is to minimise both the operation and maintenance costs and the emissions including NOx, SO2 and CO2.  

The contraint of this research is the costumer demand and satefy of the system. Moreover, they consider the daily income of selling excessive power and the cost of buying power from the main grid. 

First, they build the multi-objectives. Second, they develop (or choose?) the solving algorithm. The algorithm is designed to choose which power sources to use that will minimise the operating cost. This algorithm considers the wind speed, temperature and irradiation of th sun. Generally, the algorithm first chooses wind and solar power if they are sufficient, else uses the battery until it is fully discharge, then other alternatives power sources until it has to buy from the main grid. 

The objectives include the operation cost, the emission and the supply and load balance requirement. The operation cost includes the operating cost of each generator ($/h), the fuel costs if the power source consumes fuel ($/h), the maintainenance cost ($/h), the cost of purchasing power from the main grid, the start up cost ($/h) and incomes of selling excessive power ($/h)

Constraints include the power balance constriants, general capactiy constraints (the safe maximum capacty of each generator and minimum on/off time limits.

Interestingly, output from wind and solar generators are calculated by the wind speed, temperature and irradiation of the sun. 

I think the multiobjectives are combined together using WSA (sum up linearly). But they also use the word Pareto optimal?},

We propose a dynamic pricing scheme incentivizing consumers to achieve an aggregate load profile suitable for utilities, and study how close they can get to an ideal flat profile depending on how much information they share. When customers can share all their load profiles, we provide a distributed algorithm, set up as a cooperative game between consumers, which significantly reduces the total cost and peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of the system. In the absence of full information sharing (for reasons of privacy), when users have only access to the instantaneous total load on the grid, we provide distributed stochastic strategies that successfully exploit this information to improve the overall load profile. Simulation results confirm that these solutions efficiently benefit from information sharing within the grid and reduce both the total cost and PAR.},

Each turn, each consumer updates the probability distribution of the start time of each appliance? 

Iterative algorithm. If a job is at the last possible start time, then schedule it. Otherwise if scheduling it does not exceed the total available power, then schedule it with one probability distribution, otherwise schedule it with another probability distribution.

Issue1: without coordination, respond at the same time
Issue2: centralised management, privacy
Issue3: increasing demand, more significant peaks will be created without coordiantion


Pricing: RTP. RTP alone does not flatten the demand

Learning: deferment. Widrow-Hoff learning mechanism. At each day, it reruns the optimisation in (only Section 3.3.2?) with a probability according to the predicted prices.

Method: they predict the day-ahead prices using a weighted moving average and use the probability to select which consumers to re-optimise for the next day, to avoid all reacting to the same times? What methods do they use for predicting the prices? 
That means they avoid the original problems completely. Well sort of, they changed the unknown prices to known by predicting. Then addresses the load synchronization problem by only allowing some people to re-optimise, to achieve social welfare.

1. Background:
- smart grid: efficient integration of intermittent renewable energy sources and electric vehicles
- smart meter: key underpinings of this endeavour
- DSM technologies: alter the behaviour of users by either charging them for using electricity at peak hours, or by inducing the devices when the network signals them to
- centralised management of thousands of smart meters is a complex task 
- simply leaving smart meters to react to price or frequenecy fluctuations can lead to load sync (all react at the same time in the same way)
- more electrified, more significant peak, therefore coordination needed


This paper:
- decentralised demand side management, coordinate large populations of automanomous agents representing individual smart meters
	* smart home: deferrable loads and non-deferrable
- contribution:
	1) optimise deferment of loads using MIP
	2) illustrate the key requirements to implement fully decentralised agent-based control strategies and thereon
	3) evaluate their methods on 5000 agents
	4) evolutionary game theoretic techniques


2. Related work:
- GridWise project: market-based control techniques, where homes respond to real-time pricing, can reduce peak demand (when prices are high) to some degree


3. Smart home model:
- this work: managing loads to maximise savings while mitigating the impact on the user's lifestyle (or comfort)
- deferrable and non-deferrable loads
	* 20% loads are deferrable in UK and it is likely to grow with the increased electrification of space and water heating
- deferrable
	* four types: wet (washing machine/dishwasher), cold (fridge/freezer), water heating, space heating
	* shiftable static loads (SSLs): those precise running times and running periods
	* thermal loads: those are more dependent on the temperature
- time: half-hourly
	* set of time slots: T
- price: predicted p_t
- SSL: for any SSL l in L per household
	* a set of time slots which the device is set by the user to turn on (prefered start time and its duration I think): o_l
	* deferment of the device: d_l in {-24, -23, ..., 23, 24}, which is the decision variables
	* marginal comfort cost: delta c_l
	* overall comfort cost: c_l = delta c_l * |d_l|
	* duration: uniform distribution
	* objective: minimise the cost and comfort cost
		= comfort cost has a scaling factor
	* can be solved by standard solvers
	(each SSL has a set of time slots to be on - preferred start time and its duration) 
- thermal loads per household
	* adaptive thermosstate optimises the heating or cooling profile
	* heat pump (air-source or ground-source)
	* model and simulate the thermal properties of the home and heater based on the models proposed by someone that uses the ASHRAE model of comfort
	* the thermal leakage rate: phi in W/K
	* the internal temperature of the home at time t: tao^t_in
	* the external temperature of the home at time t: tao^t_ext
	* comfortable temperature: tao_opt (typically 22.5C)
	* heat capacity: alpha_hc
	* the total mass of air in the home: alpha_mass, computed using the air density and house volume
	* heater power rating: r_h
	* the set of time slots at which the heat pump is switched on: o_h
	* heater status: h^t_on = 1 or 0
	* total heat input in the system: 
		= eta^t_i = h^t-1_on * r_h - phi * ( tao^t-1_in - tao^t-1_ext )
	* relationship between the inside temperature at time t and the amount of heat injected in the house at time t-1:
		= tao^t_in = tao^t-1_in + ( k * eta^t_i / alpha_hc / alpha_mass )
		= k = 24 * 3600 / |T| the time (in seconds) during which the heater is on
	* comfort need: C^t_on = 1 (needed) or 0 (no needed)
	* instantaneous comfort cost: delta c^t_h =
		= C^t_on * omega_1 * ( tao^t_in - tao^t_opt )^2, if tao^t_in >= tao_opt
		= C^t_on * omega_2 * ( tao^t_in - tao^t_opt )^2  else
		= omega_1 and omega_2 are constants that scale the effect of the temp difference
		= typically omega_1 < omega_2 (meaning higher than opt is better than lower)
	* total comfort cost at time t: c^t_h
		= delta c^t_h + gamma * delta c^t-1_h
		= gamma, scale the effect of the previous time slot on the current one (and captures the psychological persistence of discomfort)
	* objective: minimise the price paid by the user and comfort cost
		= k: scale for the actual cost
		= quadratic nature
	* constraint: maximum cost at any time (budget)


4. Maximising social welfare
- assumptions:
	1) each agent i has a non-shiftable static load l_fixed
	2) the cost of electricity for the population is given by a quadratic cost function (the total cost of all is based on the aggregated demand using this function)
- challenge: 
	* though solving the aggregate problem will not scale well due to the complexity of the optimisation problem and given non-linearity of the objective function
	* A standard MIQP like CPLEX could be run for up to 75 agents with up to three deferrable loads each or the solver cannot model the problem in memory
	* not scalable to hundreads and certainly not to all 26M UK homes
	* therefore completely decentralised fashion is needed

5. Decentraslied demand-side management
- central controller can be effectrive for relatively small pool sizes of industraial and commerical consumers, though DSM at a regional or national level is more complex
- two main issues associated with applying DSM on a large scale:
	1) justify the need for a pricing signal 
	2) even if an accurate price signal is provided according to the criteria we propose, the adaptive and autonomous behaviour of agents in the system in the key component that can enable significant performance benefits in the smart grid.
- pricing mechanism:
	* fixed pricing hides the real-time costs
	* TOU simply biases the real price of electricity to incentivise users to shift loads
	* RTP provides a price signal for the next 30 minutes time slot at the current time, shown better than TOU pricing in allowing users to dynamically adjust their demand to avoid peaks when electricity more expensive
	* comparision:
		= TOU, all optimise their demand at the same time; 
		= RTP induces other peaks at these times
		= a more accurate signal allows better optimisation by reacting more often, however, just by applying RTP cannot flatten the demand
		= if a low price for the next 30-minute period is signaled, then all will switch on their devices which then results in a peak in demand at the next time period
		= such reactive behaviours can cause significant peaks
- the adaptive mechanism
	1) Widrow-Hoff learning mechanism: gradually adpt how agents defer their deferrable loads based on predicted market prices for the next day 
		= predict prices using a weighted moving average method
		= an agent i gradually adpts its deferment parameter d^i_l towrads the optimal d^i, *_l as the following:
			d^i_l (t+1) = d^i_l (t) + beta ^i ( d^i,*_l - d^i_l (t) )
		=  beta^i in (0, 1] is the learning rate
		= d^i,*_l is the optimal deferment of each device, computed by solving the SSL scheduling problem
		= there is  a beta^i for each agent i
	2) each agent i is modelled by how often it readjusts its heating profile
		= it reoptimises its thermal load profile on any particular day with a probability of alpha in (0, 1)
		= meaning it reruns the thermal load optimisation with a probability alpha according to the predicted prices for the next day
		= the exact number of agents that reoptimises daily is N * alpha where N is the total number of agents with DSM capability
		= this is to ensure not all agents reoptimise at the same time
		= the alpha is the same for all households
	3) benefits:
		* when alpha and beta are sufficienctly small, the algorithm will reach a stable and desirable outcome.
		* these adaptive mechanism ensures an effective emergent coordination among consumers.
		* no communication needed between the generators and consumers
		* when large populations of such consumers are simulated within a smart grid, it is possible, with reasonable accuracy, to predict the behaviour of the system
(Interesting. So each home optimises shiftable loads once before the day I think or at each time slot?  and then at each time slot it gradually move to that optimal schedule. Each home has a probability to reoptimise its thermal load at each time)
(what is initial d^i_l(0) ???, d^i_l(0) = 0 I think? not clear)


6. Empirical evaluation
- population: 5000
- RTP pricing based on the macro-model of the UK electricity market with a quadratically increasing marginal cost (not sure what it meanssss)
- in UK the penetration of electrical heating is currently only around 7%, SSLs take up on average 20% of the total energy usage of a house, though this may change significantly given the growing need to use more efficienct deating devices
- instances of the smart home: 
	* two set of wet SSLs (dryer and washing machine) with power rating of 2kW each
	* a thermal load (with tao_opt = 22.5, alpha_c = 1000, alpha_mass in (1000, 2000] and r_h = 2kW)
	* an average load profile is used as a probability density function (i.e., describing the probability of the device being set to turn on by the user at each half-hour period) to generate ON times for the SSLs
	* use a Poisson distribution to generate the number of times the devices are switched on in a day (with lumda = 2)
	* generate tao_ext as the average 5-min temp readings taken over a period of 5 days from the roof-top sensor at a university buildings in Jan 2010
	* the number of agents that have electrified heating starts with around 7% and is adjusted in the exps
	* experiments are repeated 100 times and the results are averaged
	* error bars plotted to represent the 95% confidence intervals (???)
- performance of the adptive mechanism (load factor)
	* centraslied system vs this
	* the load factor of the optimal solution is 0.76
	* their system converges to the optimal behaviour when alpha is reasonbly small .e.g alpha = 0.05 (neraly optimal i would say, as less than LF = 0.6)
	* takes 100 days to converge....
	* no convergence when alpha is too large as too many agents are reoptimising at the same time such that the peaks are simply moved (I ALLOW ALL TO MOVE, MORE FLEXIBLE)
	* when alpha = 1 and every user optimises at the same time, the system breaks down
	* (alpha is for the heating only. how about deferment?? )
	* (small oscillations exist after 100 iteration but looks like quite stable. they claim convergence.)
- emergent behaviour of the smart grid
	* when the LF = 0.76:
		= carbon reduction up to 6%
		= capacity reqreuiment reduction: 17%
- the effect of electrical heating
	* thermal load: 7% to 25%
	* peak reduction: 22%


Summary and thoughts
- they don't use any interaction or coordination
- each household has deferrable loads and thermal loads
	* deferrable loads: turn-on time slots and discomfort rating, no other constraints
	* thermal loads: optimal temp nd discomfort ratings, etc. 	
	* in exp: deferrable loads are just dryers and washing machines
- at each day, each smart home: 
	* optimise the deferrable loads and at each time slot, it uses learning rate beta to move towards the target optimal deferrment...
	* use a prob to decide whether it will reoptimse the thermal loads. if yes then change
- converge to the optimal LOAD FACTOR (not the schedule or something)
	* convergence takes 100 days
- prove centralised method not scalable
- my critiques:
	* they test their methods (5000 homes) against centralised which they could do for 75 homes ---> still not a lot
	* they showed the prob of load sync if all can sync at the same time and they don't allow all to optimise at once ---> I allow more flexiblity
	* so many days to converge, need to assume nearly everyday is similar. It will converge to "optimal" when the winter is over....
	* no other constraints, which may explain this learning rate works?? cannot imagine how this works if there are more appliances. Round it up?
	* need to tune alpha the probability},

  abstract   = {In this paper, we propose a novel decentralised control mechanism to manage micro-storage in the smart grid. Our approach uses an adaptive pricing scheme that energy suppliers apply to home smart agents controlling micro-storage devices. In particular, we prove that the interaction between a supplier using our pricing scheme and the actions of selfish micro-storage agents forms a globally stable feedback loop that converges to an efficient equilibrium. We further propose a market strategy that allows the supplier to reduce wholesale purchasing costs without increasing the uncertainty and variance for its aggregate consumer demand. Moreover, we empirically evaluate our mechanism (based on the UK grid data) and show that it yields savings of up to 16% in energy cost for consumers using storage devices with average capacity 10 kWh. Furthermore, we show that it is robust against extreme system changes.},
  acmid      = {2900648},
  comment    = {This research manages multiple micro-storages using an adaptive pricing scheme. 

Backgroud:
- no significant change in how home appliances are used when batteries are used per household
- intention: lower the peak demand, reduce the use of expensive peaking plants, the carbon emission and the consumer's energy cost.
- challenge: load synchronisation and unpredictable peak demand, increasing carbon emission, destablise the grid and even cause blackouts.
- aim to control the widespread micro-storage, making the aggregate demand more stable and predictable. 

Model:
- pricing:
	= Pricing signals: broadcast a day ahead
	= Day-ahead market: prices are known advanced
	= Balancing marekt: there is a price for selling excess and another one for buying excess (i gues the selling and buying prices are also known advanced?)
	= assuming consumers buy and sell electricity at the same price, not needing them to speculate the future prices to make the best profits.. 
- time: 48 pricing periods
- consumer: an aggregate load profile, fixed and known in advance
- battery: cannot charge and discharge at the same time, storage constraint
- objective: minimise their own costs
	= for each consumer: minimise the purchase cost, the running cost and the stability cost

Method:
- proposal: multi-agent systems
	= charge consumers for changing their storage profile from day to day
	= adaptive pricing scheme for suppliers to manage aggregate demand in a discentralised fashion
	= a cost for changing the battery storage profile each day (to improve stability), this stability cost has a parameter which is given by the supplier, and the parameter can be compuated from solving an optimisatoin problem (???) 
- the proposed pricing scheme is for between days
- procedure: 
	= supplier updates the prices to the current loads using a increasing differentiable pricing function. 
	= the price profile of the next day is set based on the aggregate load profile of the previous days 
	= (the new price for ecah time period is set based on the previous demand on the same period)

Thoughts:
- I don't quite understand the methods for calculating the new prices, but this method seems to be the difficult one in this paper
- This method requires extracting the distribution of the balancing prices and the aggregate load, use Monte Carlo simulations to build samples and do they kind of solve that dont-know-what optimisation problem using those samples like stochastic optimisation? 

THOUGHTS: I AM VERY LOST OF THE PRICING SCHEME, BUT I KNOW THEY DO DIFFERENTLY. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SEASONS CHANGE?

The scheduling part is not the main bit. The pricing part is and it is for between days. Interesting.},

Operation characteristics, such as expected duration and peak power consumption of the smart appliances, can be adjusted through a power profile signal. The optimal power profile signal minimizes cost, while satisfying technical operation constraints and consumer preferences. Constraints such as enforcing uninterruptible and sequential operations are modeled in the proposed framework using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Several realistic scenarios based on actual spot price are considered, and the numerical results provide insight into tariff design. Computational issues and extensions of the proposed scheduling framework are also discussed.},
  comment    = {This research calculates the optimal power profile signals that minimise the cost. 

Background: 
- power new peak levels, extra stress to balance the demand and supply. Environmental and economical reasons requires renewables. 
- Future use of PEVs will introduce more consumption. 
- Load balancing, move controlable loads to when renewab les is high. Engage consumers in load balancing. 
- Use time-varying tariff to manage demand, to reduce peak demand. 
- Issue: manual response to time-varying prices is unrealistic. So automatica decision support system is desirable. 

This paer considers residential appliances scheduling. Model the problem as reaslitically as possible. 

Models:
- appliances: 
    * an appliance operation process is divided into a set of sequential energy phases, 
    * each of which is a uninterruptible sub-task of the appliances. 
- decisions: power profiles of appliances
- prices: given ahead, day ahead
- constraints: 
    * energy phrase requireemnts, 
    * max run time
    * energy usage
    * min and max power, 
    * peak (safety) limit, total power of all appliances constraint, 
    * time window for each energy phrase, 
    * uniterruptible constraints for non-interruptible loads, 
    * sequential processing (this is interesting), 
    * between-phrase delay, 
    * user time preferneces (must be finished time)/optional time preferences
    * intteruptible but each task is divided into uniterruptible subtasks, precedence constraints (one cannot start before another), 
- objective: cost function

Methods: 
- Gurobi

Experiments: 
- compare the run time of using differnt time slot length (3, 5 and 10 minutes). 
- Three controllable appliances. 
- compared premature feasible solution with the optimal solution. Interesting. 
- not SCALABLE to scheduling for 10 devices. so should retrict the devices to just a few. 
- Good approximate solutions are good. 
- compared the solution of the maximisation problem and the minimisation problem. Interesting. 
- YALMIP MATLAB interface and CPLEX

Results (3 min, 5 min, 10 min):
- max cost saving (%): 47.43, 46.84, 47.05
- solve time (s): 860, 83.6, 15.4

Take-away:

If each home uses automated demand response which would opportunistically schedule devices that are flexible to run at any time in a large time window, towards the slots with lower electricity prices, peaks at these slots may happen. We denote such peaks as rebound peaks. We address the potential rebound peak problems of automated DR algorithms, and provide possible solutions. We illustrate why a rebound peak is possible via the insights we obtain from the optimal automated DR algorithm. We show that if the utility electricity supply cost is assumed to be a homogeneous function in the energy consumption over a certain time span, a system of multiple homes and utility company has the lowest total electricity supply cost if the electricity consumption from all the homes is flat over the time span. We study multiple approaches to reduce the rebound peak, and accordingly propose algorithms for DR at each home. Effectiveness of the approaches is verified by numerical results.},
  comment    = {This research address the load syn (rebound peaks) problem in automated demand response. They studies multiple approaches to reduce the rebound peak and propose algorithsm for DR at each home. (Interesting). Multiple homes. 

Background: DR incentives people to use less electricity when the price is high or when the system is in trouble. 
Price-based and incentive-based. This paper focuses on the price-based. Automated demand response is the trend. 

Multiple approaches: different pricing methods, max power constraint, 

Gap: no view on how to reduce the rebound peak (not true)

Contributions: illustrate the rebound peak. multiple approaches to reduce the rebound peak

Household: schedulable devices (interruptible and non-interruptible), no thermostatically controlled appliances
Device: power, total consumption requirement (instead of duration), NO must finished time
THOUGHTS: CONSIDERING BOTH, HAVING THE CONSTRAINTS FOR INTERRUPTIBLE AND THEIR MODELLING METHODS FOR NON-INTERRUPTIBLE IS INTERESTING

Constraints: all tasks done

Objective: minimise the bill

Prices: pre-given, different or the same in each interval. scheduling based on RTP is not included in this paper. 

Decision: start time

Model: the optimisaton problem can be decomposed as each device solves its own problem. 

INFO: why residential loads are interesting because more flexible loads than the industrial loads and large night time windows for residents. More explanations on the rebound peak. Useful. 

------

Cost function: convex, same in the intervals of the scheduling time span, incorporate max consumption limit. Function design is out of scope. 

heterogeneous cost function is not included but under investigation


Method 1: randomized schedule as long as all devices are done before the deadline and no minimum delay

Method 2: randomized + optimized flatten (not sure what it means) 

Method 3: different prices to homes (how though....) 

Method 4: max power limit for EVERY home (NOT IN OUR CASE, THEY AUTOMATICALLY DO THIS BUT WE CAN INCORPORATE THAT IF NEEDED) 

Experiment: four scheduable devices and four not scheduable. Each home identical (WE CAN TRY IDENTICAL AND NOT IDENTICAL) 
Fixed prices are used for scheduling but a supply cost function is used to evaluate the supply cost reduction

RESULTS: COMPLAIN ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY AND SCALABILITY OF 2 AND 4 ALTHOUGH THEY DO PERFORM BETTER

However, a pure day-ahead optimization process cannot accommodate potential real-time deviations from the expected energy consumption by the demand-side users, neither the randomness of their renewable sources. This paper proposes a day-ahead bidding system based on a pricing model that combines: i) a price per unit of energy depending on the day-ahead bid energy needs of the demand-side users, and ii) a penalty system that limits the real-time fluctuations around the bid energy loads. In this day-ahead bidding process, demand-side users, possibly having energy production and storage capabilities, are interested in minimizing their expected monetary expense. The resulting optimization problem is formulated as a noncooperative game and is solved by means of suitable distributed algorithms. Finally, the proposed procedure is tested in a realistic setup.},

Background: DSM, more secure and efficient grid and facilitate integrating renewables and distributed energy generators

Solution: two-stage pricing mode; 1) agree on prices day ahead; 2) penalty for not following their day-ahead bidding strategies in real-time

Objective: minimise expected individual expenses

Consumers: selfish, noncooperative, each consumer has total consumption requirments per time slot (energy need taken into account the renewable?? per slot)

Battery: begin and end energy level (same), capacity, min and max power rate, battery profile (decision), battery dynamics

Objective: minimise the max demand

Method:
centralised. transfer the max to a constraint. I have seen this method in another paper. Where?? 
but require collecting all information, not practical (also not possible) 
This part is the same as the Mohamad's game theoretical approach centralised issue

Prce = base price + price gap
(again I have seem this) 
Based price is calculated from a quadratic cost function
Price gap is related to the difference between the average demand and the demand at a time slot

Method: iterative
IT MAY NOT CONVERGE TO THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION (???) 
The process is like mine. Consumers optimises schedule based on the given prices, the utility collects all load profiles and updates prices. 
HOW ABOUT OSCILLATIONS? SO THE PRICING METHOD HELPS IT TO CONVERGE. INTERESTING. 

THOUGHTS:
1. THIS WORK IS VERY CLOSE TO MY WORK
2. no delay preferneces but utility 
3. the PAR reduction? compare maybe?},

  abstract   = {Demand response (DR) is very important in the future smart grid, aiming to encourage consumers to reduce their demand during peak load hours. However, if binary decision variables are needed to specify start-up time of a particular appliance, the resulting mixed integer combinatorial problem is in general difficult to solve. In this paper, we study a versatile convex programming (CP) DR optimization framework for the automatic load management of various household appliances in a smart home. In particular, an L1 regularization technique is proposed to deal with schedule-based appliances (SAs), for which their on/off statuses are governed by binary decision variables. By relaxing these variables from integer to continuous values, the problem is reformulated as a new CP problem with an additional L1 regularization term in the objective. This allows us to transform the original mixed integer problem into a standard CP problem. Its major advantage is that the overall DR optimization problem remains to be convex and therefore the solution can be found efficiently. Moreover, a wide variety of appliances with different characteristics can be flexibly incorporated. Simulation result shows that the energy scheduling of SAs and other appliances can be determined simultaneously using the proposed CP formulation.},
  comment    = {This research manages devices in a household. 

Background: DR can reduce peak load, future investment and better utilize renewables. Automate scheduling systems for DR is important. Goals of DR are to minimise the cost and maximise the satisfaction. Trade-off. 
Interesting background on optimisation techniques. 

Objective: total cost and dissatisfaction

Constraints: operating constraints of appliances and power supply
total energy required, min and max energy needs

Cost function: consider both linear and quadratic
Prices are given in the cost function

Characteristic function: linear. I don't quite get the idea
a weight that says the importance of a time slot for an appliance
this is the regularization term to relax the mixed integer linear problem to a continuous optimisation problem

Appliances: interruptible, uninterruptible, min and max power, preferred time periods for non-interruptible, time windows,d urations (i guess them from the experiment sections)
Battery: min and max power rate, capacity, 
Model-based appliances (what is this??) 

Scalability: they note that CPLEX can run into memory problems when dealing with large-scale problems

Method:
Solver

THOUGHTS:
1. THE KEY THING IS HOW THEY ADDED THE REGULARIZATION TERM TO RELAX THE PROBLEM AND MAKE IT EASIER TO SOLVE. I DONT UNDERSTAND IT COMPLETELY YET. 
THAT IS THE CONTRIBUTION. TACKLE THE COMPLEXITY ISSUE. 

2. HOW COMPLEX IS IT?? I WANT TO TRY IMPLEMENTING MYSELF. NP HARD IS OKAY BUT THE THING IS HOW LONG IT TAKES TO OPTIMISATION FOR 10 DEVICES WHEN THE PRICE IS FIXED.},

  abstract   = {Smart grids are capable of two-way communication between individual user devices and the electricity provider, enabling providers to create a control-feedback loop using time-dependent pricing. By charging users more in peak and less in off-peak hours, the provider can induce users to shift their consumption to off-peak periods, thus relieving stress on the power grid and the cost incurred from large peak loads. We formulate the electricity provider's cost minimization problem in setting these prices by considering consumers' device-specific scheduling flexibility and the provider's cost structure of purchasing electricity from an electricity generator. Consumers' willingness to shift their device usage is modeled probabilistically, with parameters that can be estimated from real data. We develop an algorithm for computing day-ahead prices, and another algorithm for estimating and refining user reaction to the prices. Together, these two algorithms allow the provider to dynamically adjust the offered prices based on user behavior. Numerical simulations with data from an Ontario electricity provider show that our pricing algorithm can significantly reduce the cost incurred by the provider.},
  comment    = {This research minimizes the cost of electricity, model consumers' wilingness to schedule using a probability model and develops an algorithm for computing day-ahead prices and another for estimating and refining user reaction to the prices. 
I think this research manages multiple consumers? 

Background: smart appliances and smart grids allow energy providers to use dynamic pricing to flatten the peak demand and achieve better resource utilizaiton. 

Features: avoid game-theoretic and social welfare models. practical framework. reduce the communication woverhead and helps ensure SCALABILITY of the model.

Gap: many don't consider the appliance level
Proposal: 1) a time-dependent pricing (TDP) scheme that incorporates devices's delay tolerantces
2) focuses on day-ahead pricing instead of RTP
3) highly scalable
4) relay on predictions of user behaviours

Method ideas: 
1) energy provide monitors the loads to estimate the consumers' willingness to shift demand, and then announce optimzed prices for the next day based on that
2) consumers respond to the prices by scheduling
3) assumption: aggregate demand each day is constant, only load shifting and no shedding
4) 24 time slots
5) supply capacity and the marginal cost of plant operation vary from period to period
6) predict supply capacty using forecasting methods

Model:
1) sensitivitiy function for each devices (linear: the probability of shiting a device to a time. different for each appliance and each consumer. 
2) baseline demand at each time for each consumer

Objective:: minimize the cost of offering rewards (discounts?) and satisfying the demand (constraints?) 

Decison: reward in each period

For consumer: calculate expected demand given the predicted demand, demand shifted given the rewards
For provide: minimize a cost of satisfying the demand and the reward cost (convex problem) 

Cost function: piecewise-linear cost structure for each types of plants (base, intermediate and peak) 

Required:
1) forecasted capacities
2) based demand
3) demand shifting probability distirbutions (sensitivity function to be calculated) 
4) cost function 

Algorithm:
1) forecast capacitys for each period
2) compute the rewareds based on the estimated capacities
3) then confusing.... using yesterday's demand to calculate the reward for the next day, then update the sensitivity function for the next day based on the calculated rewards? 
4) user delay or advance preferences --> senstivitity --> reward based on potential shifting and capacities --> update sensitivites based on previous day rewards??? cannot understand this part. 

CONTRIBUTIONS
1) the framework
2) sensitivity function design (given the parameters, the reward) ?

Experiments:
- 24 one-hour periods
1) estimated future demand from historical demand data and set the patience indeices for two different consumers
2) design devices for each consumer
3) calculate the senstivity function for each consumer, 

THOUGHTS:
1) IGNORE OPERATING CONSTRAINTS (KIND OF HAVE CONSIDERED THE CONSTRAINT) 
2) the algorithm is still confusing to me but i get the ideas
3) all users must follow the probabitlistic approach, otherwise can lead to load sync problem? or load sync problem? or just reduced? 
4) similar ideas, we calculate the probabilitistic for peoples to shift in response to different prices and calculate the final prices based on those
5) well, quite a different thing
6) so calculate rewards based on sensitivity and update the rewards based on sensitivity. one day is one iteration.

We focus on a smart grid in which the demand-side comprises traditional users as well as users owning some kind of distributed energy sources and/or energy storage devices. By means of a day-ahead optimization process regulated by an independent central unit, the latter users intend to reduce their monetary energy expense by producing or storing energy rather than just purchasing their energy needs from the grid. In this paper, we formulate the resulting grid optimization problem as a noncooperative game and analyze the existence of optimal strategies. Furthermore, we present a distributed algorithm to be run on the users' smart meters, which provides the optimal production and/or storage strategies, while preserving the privacy of the users and minimizing the required signaling with the central unit. Finally, the proposed day-ahead optimization is tested in a realistic situation.},
  comment    = {This research manages multiple consumers in a smart grid. Some consumers have abatteries or distributed energy sources. Some consumers don't. 

Background: issues in variable generation, the benefits of using DG (generation), DS (storages) and DSM to manage these variabilities, so the power systems are more stable. Game theoratical approahces are suitable because of the selfish nature of consumers

Scenario: multiples consumers with DG and/or DS, multiple providers and one coordinator. 
Consumers can have dispatchable energy producers (non-renewable ones) and non-dispatchable ones (renewables)

Variables: storage profile, production profile, demand profile

dispatchable producers: maximum (fixed) power output, 

storage: efficiency, leakage rate, capacity, power rate, initlal and final charge level

constraint: battery operating constraints, max aggregate power, generator operating constraints 

Objective: minimise costs

Cost function: quadratic, scale up and down at each time slot

Method: not centralised because of scalability and privacy issues. fully distributed, best response algorithm. 
"convergence cannot be guaranteed if the users are allowed to simultaneously adopt production and storage strategies" (??) 
A little bit like progressive hedging. Or it is like the L1 regularized term?
Idea: force the optimal solution to be close to the average solution, or make them similar
1. utility calculates some parameters, send them to users
2. user updates their optimal strategies and send back their loads?
3. the utility sends the aggregate loads to all users
4. users optimise the strategies given the aggregate loads, and send back new optimal strategies?

However, it has been an open issue to address the DRM problem in a network of multiple utility companies and consumers where every entity is concerned about maximizing its own benefit. In this paper, we propose a Stackelberg game between utility companies and end-users to maximize the revenue of each utility company and the payoff of each user. We derive analytical results for the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game and prove that a unique solution exists. We develop a distributed algorithm which converges to the equilibrium with only local information available for both utility companies and end-users. Though DRM helps to facilitate the reliability of power supply, the smart grid can be succeptible to privacy and security issues because of communication links between the utility companies and the consumers. We study the impact of an attacker who can manipulate the price information from the utility companies. We also propose a scheme based on the concept of shared reserve power to improve the grid reliability and ensure its dependability.},
  comment    = {This research manages multiple users and multiple utilities. 

Background: traditional grid cannot meet the growing demands and increasing requirements of flexiblity. Smart grid proposed. DSM is a key feature of smart grids, that can reduce bills, balance demand and supply through RTP and also short-term relaibility benefits. 

Gap: consider both the utility costs and revenue and consumer utilities. 

Contributions: multi-UCs and multi-consumers

Scenarios: residential, industrial and commerical consumers (different budget) 


Conusmers: utility function, given prices from the utility

Aggregation demand level. Only total power constraints. Ignores details on the demand side. 

Algorithms
1) each utlity sets a price and send them to all consumers
2) consumers optimise the demand and decide how much electricity to use from each utility
3) when the utility receives the demand matrix, update the prices
4) iterate until the price values convergnece

An artificial neural network ensemble is developed to predict 24-h-ahead photovoltaic generation and 1-h-ahead wind power generation and LD. The proposed machine learning is characterized by enhanced learning model and generalization capability. The efficiency of the microgrid operation strongly depends on the battery scheduling process, which cannot be achieved through conventional optimization formulation. In this paper, a fuzzy logic expert system is used for battery scheduling. The proposed approach can handle uncertainties regarding to the fuzzy environment of the overall microgrid operation and the uncertainty related to the forecasted parameters. The results show considerable minimization on operation cost and emission level compared to literature microgrid energy management approaches based on opportunity charging and Heuristic Flowchart (HF) battery management.},

  abstract   = {Energy management in microgrids is typically formulated as a non-linear optimization problem. Solving it in a centralized manner not only requires high computational capabilities at the microgrid central controller (MGCC) but may also infringe customer privacy. Existing distributed approaches, on the other hand, assume that all the generations and loads are connected to one bus and ignore the underlying power distribution network and the associated power flows and system operational constraints. Consequently, the schedules produced by those algorithms may violate those constraints and thus are not feasible in practice. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on the design of a distributed energy management strategy (EMS) for the optimal operation of microgrids with consideration of the distribution network and the associated constraints. Specifically, we formulate microgrid energy management as an optimal power flow problem and propose a distributed EMS where the MGCC and the local controllers jointly compute an optimal schedule. As one demonstration, we apply the proposed distributed EMS to a real microgrid in Guangdong Province, China consisting of photovoltaics, wind turbines, diesel generators, and a battery energy storage system. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed distributed EMS is effective in both islanded and grid-connected mode. It is also shown that the proposed algorithm converges fast.},

Background: two key issues in creating a sustainable and energy-efficiet society: reducing peak demands and increasing the penatration of renewables. Adjusting the supply only is one way to achieve demand supply balance, but it is expensive, inefficient and emit large amount of carbon. So managing the demand is more critical when the uncertainty in the supply increases. 
DR program, incentive-based (direct load control) and price based. 
Price-based, TOU or RTP with the support of recent technologies. 
RTP, two issues: not enough consumers participate, and compromise system stability due to uncontrolled sitibuted interactions (load sync) 
Solution: coordinating a group of consumers instead of individuals only

Proposal: partial cnetralization, one group coordiantor who purchases electricity from utilities, who does not set prices or incur profits to bselling to the markets, ensuring the demand goals and constraints of the group members (but members are not willing to disclose). The members decide how to schedule devices 

Benefits: 1) price advantage, large group size, volumn discount, negotiating 

Goal: minimise the cost

Challenge: the coordiator does not know all the constraints of consumers, the price depends on the aggregate load

Virtual price signals

------

Models:
Price function, differ in each time slot and has a threshold structure
Pricing problem is convex

Decision variables: demand profile of each agent

Methods: constraints are agent-specific, so separable, but the total cost is coupled, a primal decomposition, 
cannot simple pass the aggregate demand to each users and to opimised based on the given prices from the cooridnator, it will cause load sync or hering phenomenon

virtual price signals: not the future prices, but how much they would have to pay given the current total demand

When receiving new prices, first the coordinate compute the amount of demand should ideally shifted (meaning?), the amount each agent shifted and the threhold price is designed for each agent. But constraints may retricts who much demand can actually be shifted, so they design an iterative algorithm to update the prices based on the feedback



The key thing I need to understand is how they compute the prices

they did not consider appliance details.},

  abstract   = {Energy management in microgrids is typically formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. Solving it in a centralized manner does not only require high computational capabilities at the microgrid central controller (MGCC), but may also infringe customer privacy. Existing distributed approaches, on the other hand, assume that all generations and loads are connected to one bus, and ignore the underlying power distribution network and the associated power flow and system operational constraints. Consequently, the schedules produced by those algorithms may violate those constraints and thus are not feasible in practice. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on the design of a distributed energy management strategy (EMS) for the optimal operation of microgrids with consideration of the distribution network and the associated constraints. Specifically, we formulate microgrid energy management as an optimal power flow problem, and propose a distributed EMS where the MGCC and the local controllers jointly compute an optimal schedule. We also provide an implementation of the proposed distributed EMS based on IEC 61850. As one demonstration, we apply the proposed distributed EMS to a real microgrid in Guangdong Province, China, consisting of photovoltaics, wind turbines, diesel generators, and a battery energy storage system. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and fast convergence of the proposed distributed EMS.},

  abstract   = {This paper presents an efficient heuristic approach for scheduling residential smart home appliances. Using available hourly prices for electricity, the starting times of a supplied set of appliances are optimized so that the economic cost of the energy consumed is reduced, while satisfying the operational and peak power constraints. The algorithm schedules appliances one after the other based on a greedy strategy. The heuristic (c.f. exact) approach is taken to reduce the computational burden to a level allowing re-optimization to take place at regular intervals by a modest computing device without specialized software, which could be embedded in a smart meter. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through a preliminary experimental study comparing the obtained costs and computation times with an exact algorithm. Results indicate that the obtained cost was within 5% of the optimal cost, while the computation time reduced by exponential factors.},
  comment    = {This research manages appliances of multiple consumers using heuristic methods to achieve a near-optimal solution, which reduces the computation burden. 

Background: 
- general problem: unrealistic for consumers to manually respond to varying prices

Literature:
- the load scheduling problem is NP-complete problem. 
- Exact methods:
    * LP, IP
    * useful for problems of reduced size
    * require excessive computational time
- Heuristic:
    * find a good but not optimal solution in a reasonable time 
    * faster
    * using mean load as heuristic?
    * greedy heuristic that combines min-min and max-min heuristics
    * oneline heuristicis

Research goal:
- compare heuristic and exact
- schedule a set of smart home loads

Models:
- Prices: given 24 hours ahead
- Appliances:
    * consumption each running periods
    * uninterruptible and sequential energy phases
    * length of opeartion, a specified valie time slot, power consumption profile
    * time interval
- Objective: cost
- Constraints:
    * phase energy constraint
    * max power cosntraint
    * sequential processing constraint for the energy phase operation
    * energy phase duration constraints
    * uninterruptible constraints (without interruption) 
    * between-phase delay constrainst (the maximum delay between each phase) 
    * user time preferences (time window), given by users
    * operation constraint (like dryer after washing machine) 
- Decision variables: start times

Methods:
- MILP: Cplex. they said only feasible for 4-6 appliances
- Exact method: exhaustive search.... not great of course... 
- Heuristici method: a greedy strategy without back-tracking
    * implicit priority ordering (but not explicitly considered in this paper???)
    * tasks are scheduled sequentially based on a greedy strategy without back-tracking
    * three loops: a bit confusing.... 

Experiments:
- 24 timeslots
- Heuristic method may not find the optimal solution or it may even violate some constraints
- four controllable devices: washing machine, dryer, dish washer and EV
- two uncontrollable devices: heater and TV
- Heuristic method can achieve a result that is very close to the exact method
- compare the run time of heuristic and exact for 4, 6, 8 and 10 devices. 

Results (heuristic and exact):
- 4 tasks: 0.000704, 0.00246
- 8 tasks: 0.00157, 73.56s
- 10 tasks: 0.00201, NA
- only after optimisation costs, no before.

  comment    = {This research manages multiple households. Detailed models for devices (states and energy consumption for each state). 

Cooperative. 
Distributed constraint optimisation problem. 
Test with large numbers of households
Use a CP solver for each household. 


Background:
- DSM: reduce consumption by storing energy or shifting loads. 
- for an effective DSM, a coordinated evice scheduilng within a neighbourhood of buildings is necessary
	* uncoordinated scheduling may be detrimental to DSM performance without reducing peak load demands
	* privacy concerns arise when users share resources or cooperate to find suitable schedules


This work:
- coordinating smart devices across multiple smart homes
- DCOP


Literature:
- Scott, stochastic, single
- MILP, adopt suboptimal solutions due to high complexity of the problems to reduce the overall resolution time
- convex relaxation
- Difference in this work: multiple homes instead of one


Models:
- each home has:
        * must run: sensors and background loads
	* scheduable: actuators
        * household state properties (cleanliness, temperature, etc.) 
		= actuators can affect the household state
		= sensors monitor the household state
- each device has:
        * location: in the smart home which indicates whether it is a sensor or actuator (to act or to sense)
        * a set of actions to be performed
        * the relations between the actions, the device states and the home states 
        * a set of the device state properties
		= actuators can also affect their own states
	* schedule: 
		= a sequence of actions for the devices
- scheduling rules:
	* active scheduling rules:
		= like user-defined preference constraints, e.g. cleanliness of the household before a time
	* passive scheduling rules: 
		= like constraints for devices, e.g. battery dynamics
- price per household: 
	* demand times real-time energy price given in advance
- total peak demand cost: 
	* a quadratic penalty function on the aggregated energy consumption across all  homes
- household group decomposition:
	* households are grouped in coalition using some coalition formation algorithms. 
	* The optimisation is done within each coalition
	* no communication among coalitions


A predictive model:
- predict the household state and the device state given the current and the next action of the device
	* to enture the various state properties are achieved
	* capture the evolution of a state property over time and how this state property is affected by a given joint action of the relevant actuators


Problem formulation:
- local soft constraints: local cost related constraints
- local hard constraints: the scheduling rules, must be satisfied
- global soft constraints: global cost related constraints, like the total peak demand related constraints
- objective of the aggregator: reduce
	* total cost
	* peak demand


Algorithm procedure within each coalition:
- the algorithm operates in synchronous cycles
- basically only one agent is allowed changes its schedule per iteration
- initialisation: each home independently finds a solution that satisfies all rules and has the minimal (local) cost to start with
- scheduling: 
	* each home computes the consumption at each time and boardcast those energy information to all other homes
    	* when receiving all others' energy information, calculate the peak energy consumption
    	* schedule to find a new solution that is better (or the optimal if the time sllows) in the sense that if all other homes keep the same schedule, the total cost and the peak consumption of all other schedules and the new schedule of this home will be better than before
    	* each home computes the objective gain and broadcasts this gain to all other households
    	* each household check if the gain is zero. If yes the algorithm has converged, 
	* otherwise only the home with the largest gain will change its schedule to the new one. Other homes will keep the old schedules. If more than one household has the largest gain, only one household will change its schedule using an order based on the home IDs. 
- repeat: until convergence or a termination condition is satisfied (e.g. timeout, a maximum number of cycles)
- notes: the problem solved by each home is a NP-hard problems that must satisfies all constraints associated with the users' scheduling rules. 


Experiments:
- exp1: CP solver JaCoP was used for each home on Raspberry Pi, 60s timeout for the CP solver, 
	* 7 households with 9 smart actuators and 5 sensors each
- exp2: 10s timeout for the CP solver
	* 718 in Des Moines
	* 1357 in Boston
	* 3766 in San Francisco
	* households are grouped into coalitions of various sizes (1, 5, and 10 coalitions)

Results:
- less coalition (bigger group size), more peak reduction, longer computation time
- trade-off: time and optimality (IMPORTANT, pu tin the thesis)},

Following the task model consist of actuation time, operation length, deadline, and a consumption profile, the scheduler linearly copies the profile entry or maps a combinatory vector to the allocation table one by one according to the task type, which can be either preemptive or nonpreemptive. The proposed scheme expands the search space recursively to traverse all the feasible allocations for a task set. A pilot implementation of this scheduling method reduces the peak load by up to 23.1% for the given task set. The execution time, basically approximated by (The equation is abbreviated), where M, N(subscript NP), and N(subscript P) are the number of time slots, nonpreemptive tasks, and preemptive tasks, respectively, is reduced almost to 2% taking advantage of an efficient constraint processing mechanism which prunes a search branch when the partial peak value already exceeds the current best. In addition, local peak reduction brings global peak reduction by up to 16% for the home-scale scheduling units without any global coordination, avoiding uncontrollable peak resonance.},

Though RTP is believed to be an effective mechanism, challenges exist in implementing RTP for residential consumers wherein manually responding to a changing price is difficult and uncoordinated responses can lead to undesired peak demand at what are normally off-peak times. Previous research has proposed various algorithms to address these challenges, however, they rarely consider algorithms that manage very large numbers of houses and devices with discrete consumption levels. To optimise conflicting objectives under RTP prices in a fast and highly scalable manner is very challenging. We address these issues by proposing a fast and highly scalable algorithm that optimally schedules devices for large numbers of households in a distributed but non-cooperative manner under RTP. The results show that this algorithm minimises the total cost and discomfort for 10,000 households in a second and has a constant computational complexity.},

As the modern era demands the traditional power grid to be more reliable, resilient, and cost-effective, the concept of smart grid evolves and various methods have been developed to overcome these demands which make the smart grid superior over the traditional power grid. One of the essential components of the smart grid, home energy management system (HEMS) enhances the energy efficiency of electricity infrastructure in a residential area. In this aspect, we propose an efficient home energy management controller (EHEMC) based on genetic harmony search algorithm (GHSA) to reduce electricity expense, peak to average ratio (PAR), and maximize user comfort. We consider EHEMC for a single home and multiple homes with real-time electricity pricing (RTEP) and critical peak pricing (CPP) tariffs. In particular, for multiple homes, we classify modes of operation for the appliances according to their energy consumption with varying operation time slots. The constrained optimization problem is solved using heuristic algorithms: wind-driven optimization (WDO), harmony search algorithm (HSA), genetic algorithm (GA), and proposed algorithm GHSA.

  comment        = {I dont agree with what they said the optimisation is slower... They proved their improved heurisitic algorithm is better but run times were more than 2 seconds for ten devices in 24 time slots.... Not right.... Interesting anyway.... 

They consider thermal loads, operations of each devices. no est, pst and lft. 

consider average waiting time, par and cost minimisation.

  abstract  = {One of the essential factor for the better operation of an electrical power system is load demand. Normally, higher load demand leads to instability and insufficient power supply. To make an electrical power system stable and sufficient, a good correlation between demand and supply should exist. A survey conducted during 2011 indicated that residential sector is consuming 18% of total energy. Also, the demand was seen to increase rapidly close to and sometimes beyond the supply. Hence, this paper focuses on appliance scheduling for cost reduction and peak load reduction by increasing demand-side response in the smart home. A load management algorithm is developed in MATLAB which reduces both cost and peak load consumption by managing the operation according to utility controls and consumer preferences. The optimization problem was solved by using Genetic Algorithm (GA) technique. The simulation results depicted that GA can be adopted for appliance scheduling in the household, reduction of electrc bill as well as cutback of peak demand from the demand side.},

Modern communication technologies have enabled the successful implementation of smart grid (SG), which aims at provision of demand side management mechanisms (DSM), such as demand response (DR). In this paper, we propose a hybrid technique named as teacher learning genetic optimization (TLGO) by combining genetic algorithm (GA) with teacher learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm for residential load scheduling, assuming that electric prices are announced on a day-ahead basis. User discomfort is one of the key aspects which must be addressed along with cost minimization. The major focus of this work is to minimize consumer electricity bill at minimum user discomfort. Load scheduling is formulated as an optimization problem and an optimal schedule is achieved by solving the minimization problem. We also investigated the effect of power-flexible appliances on consumers’ bill. Furthermore, a relationship among power consumption, cost and user discomfort is also demonstrated by feasible region. Simulation results validate that our proposed technique performs better in terms of cost reduction and user discomfort minimization, and is able to obtain the desired trade-off between consumer electricity bill and user discomfort.},

  abstract = {In the domestic sector, increased energy consumption of home appliances has become a growing issue. Thus, reducing and scheduling energy usage is the key for any home energy management system (HEMS). To better match demand and supply, many utilities offer residential demand response program to change the pattern of power consumption of a residential customer by curtailing or shifting their energy use during the peak time period. In the present study, real time optimal schedule controller for HEMS is proposed using a new binary backtracking search algorithm (BBSA) to manage the energy consumption. The BBSA gives optimal schedule for home devices in order to limit the demand of total load and schedule the operation of home appliances at specific times during the day. Hardware prototype of smart sockets and graphical user interface software were designed to demonstrate the proposed HEMS and to provide the interface between loads and scheduler, respectively. A set of the most common home appliances, namely, air conditioner, water heater, refrigerator, and washing machine has been considered to be controlled. The proposed scheduling algorithm is applied under two cases in which the first case considers operation at weekday from 4 to 11 pm and the second case considers weekend at different time of the day. Experimental results of the proposed BBSA schedule controller are compared with the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) schedule controller to verify the accuracy of the developed controller in the HEMS. The BBSA schedule controller provides better results compared to that of the BPSO schedule controller in reducing the energy consumption and the total electricity bill and save the energy at peak hours of certain loads.},
  comment  = {Background
- power outages, increasing demand at peak times
- building more power plants, not sustainable, increasing cost, low utilisation and more pollution

- incentive-based (direct control) and price-based (rtp and cpp)

Literature
- GA + ANN
- robust optimisation and stochastic
- rule based?
- hybrid lightning search algorithm based ANN? 

Model
- no details... 
- four devices: AC, WH, WM and fridge
- household peak demand limit, comfort constraints and priority
- objective: reduce the consumption at certain periods (shed loads?)
- objective: it think it was to keep the total demand under the limit. if exceed then turn off the lower priority and shift devices outside the DR event window. 

Method
- backtracking search algorithm (BSA), a new evolutionary algorithm (not the backtracking algorithm in CP)
- proposed binary BSA
- BBSA turn the four appliances on or off according to the priority of appliancesa and the homeowner preferences

Results
- BBSA is better than BPSO (binary particle swam optimisation)

Me

- probably should read a bit more about EA vs MIP/LP
- load shedding (turn off low priority devices), rescheduling from peak to off-peak times.

The priority is assigned (to each appliance) by electricity consumers and then the proposed scheme finds an optimal solution according to the assigned priorities. Day-ahead real time pricing (DA-RTP) and critical peak pricing (CPP) are used for electricity cost calculation. To validate our proposed scheme, simulations are carried out and results show that our proposed scheme efficiently achieves the aforementioned objectives.

The problem is to schedule the operation of the appliances taking into account overall costs, climatic comfort level and timeliness.

  abstract = {With the development of smart grid, residents have the opportunity to schedule their power usage in the home by themselves for the purpose of reducing electricity expense and alleviating the power peak-to-average ratio (PAR). In this paper, we first introduce a general architecture of energy management system (EMS) in a home area network (HAN) based on the smart grid and then propose an efficient scheduling method for home power usage. The home gateway (HG) receives the demand response (DR) information indicating the real-time electricity price that is transferred to an energy management controller (EMC). With the DR, the EMC achieves an optimal power scheduling scheme that can be delivered to each electric appliance by the HG. Accordingly, all appliances in the home operate automatically in the most cost-effective way. When only the real-time pricing (RTP) model is adopted, there is the possibility that most appliances would operate during the time with the lowest electricity price, and this may damage the entire electricity system due to the high PAR. In our research, we combine RTP with the inclining block rate (IBR) model. By adopting this combined pricing model, our proposed power scheduling method would effectively reduce both the electricity cost and PAR, thereby, strengthening the stability of the entire electricity system. Because these kinds of optimization problems are usually nonlinear, we use a genetic algorithm to solve this problem.},
  comment  = {Background:
- general problems: 
   * demand for high quality and reliable supply, 
   * the pressue of global natural resources and environment
- smart grid: phycial power system + IT systems
    * incorporate  communication technologies, distribued systems, smart meters, automation, distributed storage, etc. more reliable and robust. 
- RTP

Literature:
- LP, PSO, game theory

Model:
- pricing: RTP (day ahead actually) + IBR (two tiers)
- devices: automatically operatred appliances (AOAs) like interruptible and non-~, and mantually operated appliances (MOAs)
    * the length of operation time (LOT)
    * operation time interal (OTI)
    * power consumption per hour (assume to be fixed)
- time interval: 12 mins per interval. So LOT is at least a whole number of 12. 
- objective: waiting (delay) time + cost. a weight for each objective

Methods:

Experiment:
- 8-16 AOAs are considered
- single household and 10 houseolds
- no comparision

Results:
- single household without MOA: 
    * PAR reduced from 5.22 to 3.37
    * average daily cost reduced for three months reduced from 48.65 cents to 35.97 cents
- single household with MOA: 
    * PAR reduced from 4.24 to 3.42, 
    * average daily electricity cost during three months reduced from 65.11 cents to 55.01 cents
- multiple households (10):

Equalizing the power consumption in industry may lead to the utilization of power in other service areas in an efficient way. Although industries have comparably lesser number of power consuming device types than other service areas the power consumption is quite high. To meet the demands rising in the industry, shiftable loads (devices) can be redistributed equally to all the working time slots based on the average power utilization. It can be done in a flexible manner by shaping the loads using Demand Side Management (DSM) technique in Smart Grid. The main objective is to minimize the power utilization during the electricity rush hour by effectively distributing the power available during off-peak hour. Evolutionary algorithm can be well adapted to problems where optimization is the core criteria. Any maximization or minimization problem can be solved efficiently using evolutionary algorithm. Hence, to obtain the optimized fitness function of load redistribution in industry Genetic Algorithm in Demand Side Management (GA-DSM) is chosen and it has benefited with an overall reduction of 21.91{\%} which is very remarkable. In addition to this the evaluation of the fitness function using GA-DSM is carried out in other two industrial dataset models (steel plant and wind power plant) which is unavailable so far in the literature.},

  abstract = {Power companies are unable to withstand the consumer power requirement due to growing population, industries and buildings. The use of automated electrical appliances have increased exponentially in day to day activity. To maintain a possible balance between the supply and demand the power companies are introducing the demand side management approach. As a result, consumers are adopted for load shifting or scheduling their loads into off-peak hours to reduce the electricity bill. When all the consumers are trying to run the scheduled electrical appliances at the same time then the usage of energy in the off peak hour curve is marginally high. However, service providers are in need of a load balancing mechanism to avoid over or under utilization of the power grid. In the existing works, threshold limit is applied for a home to maintain the balanced load and if the consumer exceeds it then the additional charges are applied in the bill. To overcome the above mentioned drawbacks there is a need to increase the power usage with minimum cost and reducing the waiting time. For this purpose, in this paper we implement multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, which results in the cost reduction for energy usage and minimize the waiting time for appliance execution. The result reveals that if the consumer exceeds the threshold limit, the scheduled running electrical appliances temporarily stops to maintain the energy usage under threshold level for cost benefit and resumes the stopped appliances later. Further, the proposed technique minimizes the overall electricity bill and waiting time for the execution of electrical appliances.},

  abstract = {Demand side management (DSM) is one of the important functions in a smart grid that allows customers to make informed decisions regarding their energy consumption, and helps the energy providers reduce the peak load demand and reshape the load profile. This results in increased sustainability of the smart grid, as well as reduced overall operational cost and carbon emission levels. Most of the existing demand side management strategies used in traditional energy management systems employ system specific techniques and algorithms. In addition, the existing strategies handle only a limited number of controllable loads of limited types. This paper presents a demand side management strategy based on load shifting technique for demand side management of future smart grids with a large number of devices of several types. The day-ahead load shifting technique proposed in this paper is mathematically formulated as a minimization problem. A heuristic-based Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) that easily adapts heuristics in the problem was developed for solving this minimization problem. Simulations were carried out on a smart grid which contains a variety of loads in three service areas, one with residential customers, another with commercial customers, and the third one with industrial customers. The simulation results show that the proposed demand side management strategy achieves substantial savings, while reducing the peak load demand of the smart grid.},

- proposal: a heuristic based evolutionary algorithm

DSM:
- six methods: peak clipping, valley filling, load shifting, strategic conservation, strategic load growth and flexible load shape
- load shifting takes advantage of time independence of loads and shifts loads from peak to off-peak times. 

Model:
- shiftable devices
- objective: the power differences between the actual load and the desired load at all time slots; inconvenience?? not sure how it is incorporated. 
- load priority
- constraints: maximum delay
- tunable parameters: crossover rate and mutation rate, and the maximum number of iterations

Experiments: 
- three areas: residential (2604 devices of 14 types), commerical (808 devices of 8 types) and industrial (100 devices of 6 types)
- forecasted whoesale prices and load consumption of each area were given

Results:
- residential: 5% reduction in the operating cost
- commercial: 5.8% reduction in the operating cost
- industrial: 10% reduction in the operating cost
- customers: 5% to 10% cost savings
- all experiments were done in 6 hours

Each of the households is equipped with a variety of appliances. The model takes the preferences of participating households into account and aims to minimize the overall production cost and, in parallel, to lower the individual electricity bills. In the existing literature, customers submit binary values for each time period to indicate their operational preferences. However, turning the appliances “on” or “off” does not capture the associated discomfort levels, as each appliance provides a different service and leads to a different level of satisfaction. The proposed model employs integer values to indicate household preferences and models the scheduling problem as a multi-objective mixed integer programming. The main thrust of the framework is that the multi-level preference modeling of appliances increases their “flexibility”; hence, the job scheduling can be done at a lower cost. The model is evaluated by using the real data provided by the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change, UK. In the computational experiments, we examine the relation between the satisfaction of consumers based on the appliance usage preferences and the electricity costs by exploring the Pareto front of the related objective functions. The results show that the proposed model leads to significant savings in electricity cost, while maintaining a good level of customer satisfaction.},

The first type of appliances have flexible starting time and work continuously with a fixed power. The second type of appliances work with a flexible power in a predefined working time. The consumers can adjust the starting time of the first type of appliances or reduce the power consumption of the second type of appliances to reduce the payments. However, this will also incur discomfort to the consumers. Assuming the electricity price is announced by the service provider ahead of time, we propose a power scheduling strategy for the residential consumers to achieve a desired trade-off between the payments and the discomfort. The power scheduling is formulated as an optimization problem including integer and continuous variables. An optimal scheduling strategy is obtained by solving the optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the scheduling strategy can achieve a desired tradeoff between the payments and the discomfort.},

  abstract = {Home energy management system (HEMS) is essential for residential electricity consumers to participate actively in demand response (DR) programs. Dynamic pricing schemes are not sufficiently effective for end-users without utilizing a HEMS for consumption management. In this paper, an intelligent HEMS algorithm is proposed to schedule the consumption of controllable appliances in a smart household. Electric vehicle (EV) and electric water heater (EWH) are incorporated in the HEMS. They are controllable appliances with storage capability. EVs are flexible energy-intensive loads, which can provide advantages of a dispatchable source. It is expected that the penetration of EVs will grow considerably in future. This algorithm is designed for a smart household with a rooftop photovoltaic (PV) system integrated with an energy storage system (ESS). Simulation results are presented under different pricing and DR programs to demonstrate the application of the HEMS and to verify its’ effectiveness. Case studies are conducted using real measurements. They consider the household load, the rooftop PV generation forecast and the built-in parameters of controllable appliances as inputs. The results exhibit that the daily household energy cost reduces 29.5%–31.5% by using the proposed optimization-based algorithm in the HEMS instead of a simple rule-based algorithm under different pricing schemes.},

- high penetration of RES -> power generation volatility and the uncertainty of the grid

- optimisation of consumption scheduling, core of the demand-side management
- price-responsive, driven by dynamic rates
- controllable DR programs, controlled and curtail loads by an external entity
- barriers to the wide adoption of DR programs: lack of smart metering infrastructure and conumsers/ limitations ot effectively respond to the pricing or incentive signals

This chapter describes constraint-based scheduling as the discipline that studies how to solve scheduling problems by using constraint programming (CP). Constraint-based planning in turn is the discipline that studies how to solve planning problems by CP. The chapter discusses that constraint-based scheduling is one of the most successful application areas of CP. One of the key factors of this success lies in the fact that a combination was found of the best of two fields of research that pay attention to scheduling—namely, operations research (OR) and artificial intelligence (AI). The chapter reviews that OR approach aims at achieving a high level of efficiency in its algorithms whereas AI research tends to investigate more general scheduling models and tries to solve the problems by using general problem-solving paradigms. The use of CP in planning is because of the problem complexity, which is less mature than its use in scheduling. Constraint-based planning thus follows the same pattern as constraint-based scheduling where CP is used as a framework for integrating efficient special purpose algorithms into a flexible and expressive paradigm. It also presents CP models for scheduling together with descriptions of propagation techniques for constraints used in these models.},
  comment   = {Scheduling: generally is about allocating scarce resources to a given set of activities over time. Constraint-based scheduling is the discipline that studies how to solve scheduling problems by constraint programming. 

CBS has grown into one of th emost successful application areas of CP (CP has been very successful in scheduling quote the lecture notes). CBS combines OR and AI techniques (what does it mean yet?) 

OR techniques based on mathematical methods that exploits the combinatorial structure of the problems. It can be very efficient at solving problems in a more limited application area (in specific areas). AI techniques investigae more general scheduling models and tries to solve problems by using general problem-solving paradigms. It can be less efficient in specific cases where an efficient OR algorithm exists. 

Global constraints in CP incorporates OR algorithms. (Use OR algorithms to propagate global constraints). The basics of many of the algorithms inside global constraints, certainly in the early stages of the field, can be found in OR. In this way, one can preserve the general modelling and problem-solving paradigm of CP while the integration of efficient propagation algorithms improves the overall performance of the approach. 

CBS has two strengthens: 1) natural and flexible modelling of the problems and 2) powerful propagation of temporal and resource constraints. As over the years, dedicated global constraint propagation techniques for resource constraints have received a lot of attention. 

Model of the CBS problems:
- activity:
    * start time
    * end time
    * processing time (duration)
    * releast date (earliest start time)
    * deadline (latest end time)
    * latest start time
    * earliest end time
- activity types:
    * non-preemptive: not interruptible
    * preemptive: interruptible
    * elastic: like power flexible but the total consumption over some time must meet a given amount
- resources:
    * disjunctive: machines can at most execute one activity at a time
    * cumulative: resources exist that can execute several activities in paralletl provided that the resource capacity is not exceeded
    * limit
- temporal constraints
    * precedence constraint
- extension:
    * alternative resources
    * setup times and setup costs
    * optimal activities/leaving activities unperformed
    * state resources
- objective function
    *  e.g.: minimising the makespan, the sum of setup times/costs, the number of late activities, the maximum or average tardiness or earlieness, storage costs, alternative costs, the peak or average resource utilization. 
    * objectives/criteria are either formulated as a sum or as a maximum
    * optional: a due date (preferred start time) for each activities 
    * lateness: the difference between the completion time and the due date (inconvenience) 
    * penalty: each penalty per late job

CBS benefits:
- a powerful combination of OR and AI. 
    * From OR its efficient algorithms and its culture for searching for efficient algorithms were used
    * from AI the general modelling and problem-solving paradigm of CP and its culture for searching for natural ways of modeling a problem in the needed real-life detail were used},

This chapter reviews that number of operations research (OR) methods have found their way into constraint programming (CP). This development is entirely natural, as OR and CP have similar goals. It discusses that OR is essentially a variation on the scientific practice of mathematical modeling. It describes phenomena in a formal language that allows one to deduce consequences in a rigorous way. Unlike a typical scientific model, however, an OR model has a prescriptive and a descriptive purpose. It represents a human activity with some freedom of choice, rather than a natural process. The laws of nature become constraints that the activity must observe, and the goal is to maximize some objective subject to the constraints. CP's constraint-oriented approach to problem solving poses a prescriptive modelling task very similar to that of OR. CP historically has been less concerned with finding optimal than feasible solutions, however this is a superficial difference. It is to be expected, therefore, that OR methods find application in solving CP models. The chapter concludes that CP can design specialized algorithms for individual constraints or subsets of constraints, thereby exploiting substructure in the problem that OR methods are likely to miss. OR algorithms, on the other hand, can exploit global properties of the problem that CP can only partially capture by propagation through variable domains.},
  comment   = {Differences between the way CP and OR understands constraints
- CP: sees a constraint as a procedure or at least as invoking a procedure to reduce the variable domains.

OR in CP
- apply OR to a constraint or subsets of constraints to reduce variable domains.
- use the solutions from a relaxation of the CP problem in the form of an OR model, then use the solution to tighten bounds, guide the search or the propagation, etc.

This chapter provides an overview of global constraints. It discusses different types of constraints, measures of filtering and different compromises between efficiency and effectiveness of filtering. It describes global constraint as a constraint that captures a relation between a nonfixed numbers of variables. The chapter reviews one of the central ideas of constraint programming: the propagation-search technique that consists of a traversal of the search space of the given constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) while detecting “dead ends” as early as possible. An algorithm that performs only the search component would enumerate all possible assignments of values to the variables until it either finds a solution to the CSP or exhausts all possible assignments and concludes that a solution does not exist. Such an exhaustive search has an exponential time complexity in the best case, and this is where propagation comes in: it allows the constraint solver to prune useless parts of the search space without enumerating them. The chapter also describes global optimization constraints—that is, constraints that encapsulate optimization criteria and filtering algorithms for them.},

This chapter explores that there are three main algorithmic techniques for solving constraint satisfaction problems: (1) backtracking search, (2) local search, and (3) dynamic programming. An algorithm for solving a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) can be either complete or incomplete. Complete or systematic algorithms, come with a guarantee of a solution if one exists, and can be used to show that a CSP does not have a solution and to find a provably optimal solution. Backtracking search algorithms and dynamic programming algorithms are examples of complete algorithms. Incomplete, or nonsystematic algorithms, cannot be used to show a CSP does not have a solution or to find a provably optimal solution. However, such algorithms are often effective at finding a solution if one exists and can be used to find an approximation to an optimal solution. Of the two classes of algorithms that are complete—backtracking search and dynamic programming—backtracking search algorithms are currently the most important in practice. These work on only one solution at a time and thus need only a polynomial amount of space.},
  comment   = {There are three main algorithmic techniques for solving CSP: backtracking search, local search and dyamic programming. 

An algorithm for a CSP can be either complete or incomplete. Complete algorithms come with a guarantee that a solution will be found if one exists, and can be used to show that a CSP does not have a solution and to find a provably optimal solution. Backtracking search algorithms and dynmic programming algorithms are, in general, examples of complete algorithms. Local or stochastic search algorithms are examples of incomplete algorithms. 

The drawbacks of dynamic programming approaches are that they often require an exponential amount of time and space, and they do unnecessary work by finding, or making it possible to easily generate, all solutions to a CSP. In constrast, backtracking search algorithms work on only one solution at a time and thus need only a polynomial amount of space. 

The naive backtracking algorithm (BT) is the starting point for all of the more sophisticated backtracking algorithms. 

Branching strategies: 

selecting a variable x and adding a branch to a new node. A variable ordering heurisitic is used to select the next variable to branch on and the ordering of the branches is determined by a value ordering heuristic. 

Constraint propagation

A fundamental insight in improving the performance of backtracking algorithms on CSPs is that lcal inconsistencies can lead to much thrashing or unproductive search. A local inconsistency is an instantiation of some of the variables that satisfies the relevant constraints but cannot be extended to one or more additional variables and so cannot be part of any solution. 

A generic scheme to maintain a level of local consistency in a backtracking search is to perform constraint propagation at ach node in the search tree. Constraint propagation algorithms remove local inconsistencies by posting additional constraints that rule out or remove the inconsistencies. When used during search, constraints are posted at nodes as the search progresses deeper in the tree. 

Backtracking search integrated with constraint propagation has two important benefits. First, removing inconsistencies during search an dramatically prune the search tree by removing many deadends and by simplify the remaining subproblem. Second, some of the most important variable ordering heuristics make user of the information gathered by constraint propagation to make effective variable ordering decisions. Now it is standard for a backtracking algorithm to incorporate some form of constraint propagation. 

Heuristics for backtracking algorithms

When solving a CSP using backtracking search, a sequence of decisions must be made as to which variable to branch on or instantiate next and which value to give to the variable. These decisions are referred to as the variable and the value ordering. It has been shown that for many problems, the choice of variable and value ordering can be crucial to effectively solving the problem. 

Given a CSP and a backtracking search algorithm, a variable or value ordering is said to be optimal if the ordering results in a search that visits the fewest number of nodes over all possible orderings when finding on solution or showing that there does not exist a solution. 

Little is known about how to find optimalorderings or how to construct polynomial-time approximation algorithms --- algorithms which return an ordering which is guaranteed to be near-optimal. The field of constraint programming has so far mainly focused on heuristics which have no formal guarantees. 

Heuristics can be either application-independent, where only generic features common to all CSPs are used, or application dependent. However, there is no one best variable or value ordering heuristic and there will remain problems where these application-ibdependent heuristics do no work well enough and a new heuristic must be designed. 

Variable ordering heuristics

The task of the variable ordering heuristic is to choose the next variable x to be branched on. 

Value ordering herusticis

Suppose that the backtracking search is attempting to extend a node and the variable ordering heuristic has chosen variable x to be branched on next. The task of the value ordering heuritsic is to choose the next value a for x. 

Optimisation

In some important application areas of constraint programming such as scheudling, sequencing and planning, CSPs arise which have, in addition to constraints which must be satisfied, an objective function f which must be optimised. 

To solve otimisation CSPs, the common approach is to find an optial solution by solving a sequence of CSPs. Initially, a backtracking search is used to find any solution which satisfies the constraints. A constraint is then added to the CSP of the form c<f(S) which excludes solutions that are not better than this solution. A new solution is then found for the augmented CSP. This process is repeated until the resulting CSP is unsatisfiable, in which case the last solution found has beeb proven optimal.},

  comment   = {Constraint reasoning involves various types of techniques to tackle the inherent intractability of the problem of satisfying a set of constraints. Constraint propagation is one of those types of techniques. Constraint propagation is central to the process of solving a constraint problem, and we could hardly think of constraint reasoning without it. 

Constraint propagation embeds any reasoning which consists in explicitly forbidding values or combinations of values for some variables of a problem because a given subset of its constraints cannot be satisfied otherwise. 

Background:

A CSP involves finding solutions to a constraint network, that is, assignments of values to its variables that satisfy all its constraints. 

The constraint satisfaction problem being NP-complete, it is usually solved by backtrack search procedures that try to extend a partial instantiation to a global one that is consistent. Explorig the whole space of instanitiations is of course too expensive. The idea behind constraint propagation is to make the constraint network more explicit (or tighter) so that backtrack search commits into less inconsistent instantiations be detecting local inconsistency earlier. 

Specific propagators in solvers

All constraint solvers attach a specific propagation algorithm to the specific types of constraints they contain. One specific type is global constraints. It is interesting to incorporate global constraints in constraint solvers so that users can use them to express the corresponding constraint pattern easily. Because these global constraints can be used with a scheme of any size, it is important to have a way to propagate them without suing generic arc consistency algorithms.},

This chapter focuses on the emergence of constraint satisfaction, with constraint languages, as a new paradigm within artificial intelligence and computer science. It discusses that constraint satisfaction, in its basic form, involves finding a value for each one of a set of problem variables where constraints specify that some subsets of values cannot be used together. Constraint satisfaction problems have been tackled by a dizzying array of methods, from automata theory to ant algorithms, and are a topic of interest in many fields of computer science and beyond. It also focuses on the basic methods involved in the establishment of constraint satisfaction as a branch of artificial intelligence. This new branch of artificial intelligence, together with related work on programming languages and systems that laid the groundwork for the flourishing of interest in constraint programming languages. The chapter reviews the progress that has been made in making even more powerful methods available to the constraint programme. It concludes that constraint programming is still “somewhat of an art”. The challenge is to make constraint programming more of an engineering activity and constraint technology more transparently accessible to the nonprogrammer.},
  comment   = {Constraint satisfaction (CS) involves finding a value for each one of a set of problem variables where constraints specify that some substes of values cannot be used together. Like most fields of AI, CS can be separated into (overlapping) concerns with representation and reasoning. The former can be divided into generic and application-specific concerns, the latter into search and inference. 

In AI interest in CS developed in two streams: language stream and algorithm sreams. The challenge is to reintegrate the language and algorithm streams. 

Reasoning: inference and search

The algorithms for solving CSPs can be divided into two broad categories: infererence and search, and various combinations of those two approaches. In inference techniques, local constraint propagation can eliminate large subspaces from the solution space. Search systematically explores the solution space, often eliminating subspaces wih a single failure. The success of both strategies hinges on the simple fact that a CSP is conunctive: to solve it, all of the constraints must be satisfied so that a local failure on a subset of variables rules out all putative solutions with the same projection onto those variables. 

Inference: constraint propagation using network consistency

The major development in inference techniques for CSP was the discovery and development of network consistency algorithms for constraint propagation. There are two major themes in the early work on iproving backtracking: controlling search and interleavinb inference (constraint propagation) with search. 

Search: Backtracking

Backtrack is the fundamental 'complete' search method for constraint satisfaction problems, in th esense that one is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists. In general, constraint propagation, most commonly in the form of partial or complete arc consistency, can be carried out before, and/or during, search, in an attempt to prune the search space.},

This chapter describes constraint programming as a powerful paradigm for solving combinatorial search problems that draws on a wide range of techniques from artificial intelligence, computer science, databases, programming languages, and operations research. It is currently applied with success to many domains, such as scheduling, planning, vehicle routing, configuration, networks, and bioinformatics. The basic idea in constraint programming is that the user states the constraints and a general purpose constraint solver are used to solve them. The chapter reviews that Constraints are just relations, and a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) states which relations should hold among the given decision variables. It discusses that constraint solvers take a real-world problem like this, represented in terms of decision variables and constraints, and find an assignment to all the variables that satisfies the constraints. Constraint solvers search the solution space either systematically, as with backtracking or branch and bound algorithms, or use forms of local search which may be incomplete. However, the chapter concludes that constraint programming is also “programming” in the sense of “computer programming:” the user needs to program a strategy to search for a solution. Without this, the solving process would be inefficient. This is how it is done in logic-based programming languages, such as constraint logic programming, but it can also be done in other programming paradigms.},

It is assumed that the problem to be solved can be represented as a CSP whose domains are finite. It discusses that a complicating factor in modelling is the interaction between the model, the search algorithm and the search heuristics. It also assumes that, having modelled the problem of interest as a CSP. The default complete search algorithms provided by these solvers are sufficiently similar that they provide a common context for discussing modelling.

This chapter examines that constraint programming (CP) has proven to be a very successful technique for reasoning about assignment problems. It discusses that CP makes two assumptions about the problems it tackles: (1) there is no uncertainty in the problem definition: each problem has a crisp and complete description, and (2) problems are not dynamic: they do not change between the initial description and the final execution of the solution. Many real and important problems involve change and uncertainty. Solutions are required that take account of vagueness in the problem description, or that minimise the effect of the uncertainty on the solution. Basic approaches to handling change include rapid reaction through re-specifying the problems and re-solving when the changes occur, preparing to change by maintaining explanations and data structures that will allow the solver to avoid repeating work, or proactively generating solutions that are robust, by explicitly reasoning about the possible changes. A number of different techniques have been developed, and they have demonstrated that constraint programming methods can be extended to handle many different forms of dynamism and uncertainty, and that many exemplar problems can be solved efficiently. Constraint programming toolkits need to be extended with facilities to handle such problems.},

LP
- early problem solving techniques that is closely related to the solving of combinatorial problems. 
- described as a set of linear constraints over a set of continuous variablaes. 
- problems form:

minimise: sum(j in C) c_j * x_j

subject to: bl_i <= sum(j in C) a_ij x_j <= bu_i    for all m (i = 1)
                   l_j <= x_j <= u_j     j in N (all variables)
                   x_j in R                   j in C (all continuous variables) 

- Simplex (Dantzig, 1963), primary solving methods and remains the most popular in LP. Since then, much work on iproving the algorithms. Extremely efficient implementation in solvers. 


MIP
- similar to LP but include the concept of integer variables, 
- non-linearity require more complex solving methods
- mip solved by solving LP that describe subproblems of the MIP using a variant of the brunch and bound approach (Land et al. 1960 and Dakin 1965). Some solvers use interior-point algorithms (Wright, 2005) which may suit certain problesm better.
- formulation:

add x_j in Z, j in I (all integer variables) to the formulation
- Branch and bound: 
   * repeatly solving LP with a brunch and bound style algorithm
    * first, solve the relaxation (treat all integer variables as continuous variables) using an LP method. If the integer variables are given integer values, then yes
    * select integer variables using some variable selection heuristic. 
    * once the variable is selected, the solver creates two subproblems: first, with the variable bound to be less than or equal to the floor of its assigned value; and the second, where the variable is bound to be greater than the ceiling of its assined value. If a subproblem is found to be unsatisfiable the solver backtracks to the previous decision, and continues to search the remaining, unexplored subproblems. When a valid solution to a subproblem is found, a bound on the objective value can be udpated and used to trivally discard remaining unexplored subproblems. When there are no more unexpeclored subproblems, the solver has either proven that the last found solution is indeed optimal or if no solution has been found, that there is no solution and the problem is unsatisfiable. 
- MIP benefits: mature, decades of research and development; and simple languages but difficult to describe more complex problems. Sometimes complicated formulations that require intermediate variables to be introduce to describe complex relationships. 
    * intermediate variables: binary indicator variables
    * BigM for example.  To describe 0 <= x <= 5, 
    * either x=0, b0=1, x=1, b1=1, ...,
    * or x - Mb <= 5},

1. Optimality conditions

- the simplest is unconstrainted minimisation, one level up is equality constrained minimisation and another important problem is inequality constrained minimisation. The most general problem involves both equality and inequality constraints. 

2. Linesearch methods for unconstrainted optimisation

- an iteration is simply a procedure whereby a sequence of points is generated, starting from some initial guess, with the overall aim of ensuring that (a subsequence) has favourable limiting properties. 
    * we willl no be able to guarantee that our iteration will converge to a global minimiser unless we know that f objets very strong conditions, nor regrettably in general that any limit point is even a local minimiser. 
    * At the very least, the iteration is globally convergent, that is that (For at least) a subsequence of iterates converges to zero.
    * our hope is that such a sequence converges at a reasonably fast asymptotic rate. 

- 2.1 linesearch methods
    * generally, linesearch methods work as follows:
    * firstly, a search directionp_k is calculated from x_k. This direction is required to be a descent direction, so that for small steps along p_k, Taylor's theorem guarantees that the objective function may be reduced. 
    * secondly, a suitable stepleghth a_k is calculated so that the objective value is reduced. The computation of a_k is the line search and may itself be an iteration. 
    * finally, given both search direction and steplength, the iteration concludes by setting x_k+1 = x_k + a_k * p_k
    * such a scheme sounds both natural and simple. Though it needs to be refined somehwat in order to become a viable technique. the decrease per iteration can be so small (the steps are too long) that the iterates converge to +1 -1, neither of which is a stationary point. OR the steps are so small that each iterate falls woefully short of the minimiser and ultimately converge to the non-stationary value 1. Therefore a simple-minded linesearch method can fail if the linesearch allows steps that are either too long or too short relative to the amount of decrease that might be obtained with a well-chosen step. 

- 2.2 practical linesearch methods
    * early days, exact linesearch where a_k is chosen to minimise f(x_k + a* p_k). Though in most cases, exact linesearches prove to be both very expensive and definitely not cost effective, and are consequently rarely used nowadays. 
    * modern linesearch methods: inexact linesearches, pick steps that are neither too long nor too short. They aim to pick a useful initial guess for each stepsize so as to ensure fast asymptotic convergence. One of these methods is called backtracking-Armijo linesearch. 

- 2.3 convergence
(not sure what it means) "requiring p_k be a descent direction is not a sufficnetly demanding requirement. "

-2.4  method of steepest descent (Generic linesearch steepest-descent method) 
    * steepest-descent: minimise the first order approximation of the objective function
   * the steepest-descent direction gives the greatest possible reduction in a first-order model of the objective function for a step whose length is specified. 
    * problems: 1) this method is not scale invariant. 2) convergence may be very slow in theory while numberically convergnece sometimes does not occur at all as the iteration stagnates. 
    * in practise, this method is worthless in most cases --- typically the iterates repeatedly oscillate from one side of a objective function "valley" to the other. 
    * all these problems may be attributed to a lack of attention to problem curvature when building the search direction

- 2.5 more general descent methods
    * newton direction: minimise the second order approximation of the objective function
    * will usually ocnverge very rapidly indeed and fatser than the steepset descent. though it is only useful in a linesearch context if the Hessian is positive defininte, otherwise p_k might turn out to be an ascent direction
    * modified-newton methods: when Hessian is indefinite
    * quasi-newton methods: when computing exact second derivatives is onerous or when gradients are awkward to obtain (such as when the function values are simply given as the result of some other, perhaps hidden, computation) 
    * conjugate-gradient and truncated new-ton methods: when the problem is large and matrix factorisation is out of the questions; it is something between the simplicity of steepest descent and the power of newton-like methods. (using a curtailed conjugate gradient step within a linesearch framework is known as a truncated-newton method. )

4 Active-set methods for linearly constrained optimisation

linearly-constraint optimisaiton problem is to minimise where the feasible set if a polytope, make up from a finite number of linear equations and/or inequalities. 

The particularly famous special case of linear programming (LP) occurs when f(x) = <g, x>; there are very special (and very efficient) methods for LP, some of which are based on the observation that for this problem the solution must lie at a vertex of the feasible region. 

Quadratic programming (QP) where f(x) = <g,x> + 1/2 x^T Hx for some given symmertirc H. 

- 4.1 QP
minimise q(x) = <g,x> + 1/2 <x, Hx> subject to Ax >= b
where H is a given n by n symmertric matrix and g is an vector

    * A QP is convex if H is positive semi-definite (i.e., <x, Hx> >=0 for all x). For such problems, any local minimser is a global one and of course LP is the special case for which H=0. 
    * A QP is stricly convex is H is positive definite (i.e., <x, Hx> >0 for all x!=0), and for these the minimiser will be uniqe. 
    * A QP is non-convex when H may be indefinite (i,e., <x, Hx> <0 for some x). It may have many local minimisers and indeed the problem may be unbounded from below. In any event, for non-convex QPs we will often have to be content with finding a local minimiser.

The four chapters that consider such problems roughly correspond to the following classification scheme. Consider a constrained minimization problem having n variables and m constraints. Methods can be devised for solving this problem that work in spaces of dimension n − m,{\thinspace} n,{\thinspace} m, or n + m. Each of the following chapters corresponds to methods in one of these spaces. Thus, the methods in the different chapters represent quite different approaches and are founded on different aspects of the theory. However, there are also strong interconnections between the methods of the various chapters, both in the final form of implementation and in their performance. Indeed, there soon emerges the theme that the rates of convergence of most practical algorithms are determined by the structure of the Hessian of the Lagrangian much like the structure of the Hessian of the objective function determines the rates of convergence for a wide assortment of methods for unconstrained problems. Thus, although the various algorithms of these chapters differ substantially in their motivation, they are ultimately found to be governed by a common set of principles.},

  comment   = {- Advantage of Primal Methods

    * A primal method means a search method that works on the original problem directly by searching through the feasible region for the optimal solution. Each point in the process is feasible and the value of the objective function constantly decreases. 

    * three significant advantages: 
        1) each point generated in the search procedure is feasible and the terminating point is also feasible. Thus the final point is feasible and probably nearly optimal solution to the original problem and therefore may represent an acceptable solution. 
        2) if they generate a convergent sequence, the limit point of that sequence must be at least a local constrained miimum. 
        3) most primal methods do not rely on special problem structure and are applicable to general nonlinear programming problems. 

    * disadvantages:
         1) require a phase I procedure to obtain an initial feasible point 
         2) remaining in the feasible region can be computational difficult
         3) some methods can fail to converge for problems with inequality constraints unless elaborate precautions are taken

    * the convergence rates of primal methods are competitive with those of other methods, and particularly for linear constraints, they are often among the most efficient. 


- Feasible Direction Methods

    * the idea is to take steps through the feasible region of the form: x_k+1 = x_k + alpha_k * d_k where d_k is a direction vector and alpha_k is a nonnegative scalar. The scalar is chosen to minimise the objective function f with the restriction that the point x_k+1 and the line segment joining x_k and x_k+1 be feasible. This motivates the use of feasible directions for the directions of search. A vector d_k is a feasible direction if there is an bar(alpha) > 0 such that x_k + alpha * d_k is feasible for all alpha, o <= alpha <= bar(alpha). A feasible direction method can be considered as a natural extension of our unconstrained descent methods. Each step is the composition of selecting a feasible direction and a constrained line search. 

     * Frank-Wolfe Method: one of the earliest proposals for a feasible diretion method uses a sequential linear programming subproblem approach. Given a feasible point x_k, the direction vector d_k = x*_k - x_k where x*_k is a solution to the linear problem:
        minimise reverse_triangle f(x_k) * x 
        subject to a^T_i x <= b_i, i = 1, ...., m

    * two major shortcomings of feasible direction methods that require that they be modified in most cases:
        1) for general problems there may not exist any feasible directions
        2) in simplest form most feasible direction methods are not globally convergent. They are subject to jamming (sometimes referred to as zigzagging) where the sequence of points generated by the process converges to a point that is not even a constrained local minimum point. 

    * it is possible to develop feasible direction algorithms that are closed and hence not subject to jamming. However, such methods can become somewhat complicated. A simpler approach for treating inequality constraints is to use an active set method. 


- The Gradient Projection Method

    * this method is motivated by the ordinary method of steepest descent for unconstrained problems. The negative gradient is projected onto the working surface in order to defind the direction of movement. 

    * at the feasible point x, we seek a feasible direction vector d satisfying reverse_triange f(x) * d < 0, so that movement in the direction d will cause a decrease in the function f. 
   
    * we next consider selection of the step size. As alpha is increased from zero, the point x + alpha * d will initially remain feasible and the corresponding value of f will decrease. We find the lengh of the feasible segment of the line emanating from x and then minmise f over this segment. 

    * next, consider the possibility that the projected negative gradient is zero. 

    * the project matrix need not be recomputed in its entirety at each new point. This important feature of the gradient projection method greatly reduces the computation required at each step. 

    (i don't really want to understand this method at this point. If i do, reading the example at page 367 will help. ) 


- The Reduced Gradient Method

    * from a computational viewpoint, this method is closely related to the simplex method of linear programming. From a theoretical viewpoint, the method can be shown to behave very much lithe gradient project method. 

     * variables are partitioned into two groups: x = (y, z) where y has dimension m and z dimension n- m. All variables in y are strictly positivie. We can regard z as consisting of the independent variables and y the dependent variables. Selecting a trianage(z) and moving z on z + alpha * triange(z), alpha >=0 will move from one feasible solution to another. 

    * the idea of the reduced gradient method is to consider, at each stage, the problem only in terms of the independent variables. In the active set form of the reduced gradient method, the vector z is moved in the direction of the reduced gradient on the working surface. 

    * the reduced gradient at any step is calculated by evaluating the n-dimensional gradient and "pricing out" the dependent variables just as the reduced cost vector is calculated in linear programming. 


- Summary

    * the concept of feasible direction methods is a straightforward and logical extension of the methods used for unconstrained problems but leads to some subtle difficulties. These methods are susceptible to jamming (lack of global convergence) because many simple diretion dinding mappings and the usualy line search ampping are not closed) 

    * problems with inequality constraints can be approached with an active set strategy. 

    * the most practical primal methods are the gradient projection methods and the reduced gradient method. Both can be regarded as the method of steepest descent applied on the surface defined by the active constraints. The rate of convergence for the two methods can be expected to be approximately equal. Of the two methods, the reduced gradient method seems to be best. It can be saily modified to ensure against jamming and it requires fower computations per iterative step and there, for most problems, will probably converge in less time than the gradient projection method.},

  comment   = {- algorithms for unconstrained optimisation problems

The optmisation algorithms for unconstrained problems have the general form: x_k+1 = x_k + alpha_k * d_k. 
Such an algorithm is not immediately applicable to solving constrained optimisation problems in which the decision variable is required to lie within a prespecified constraint set. 

- projections

When using such an algorithm to solve the constrained problem, the iterates x_k may not saatisfy the constraints. 
We need to modify the algorithms to take into account the presence of the constraints. 
A simple modification involves the introduction of a projection. The idea is:

    * if x_k + alpha_k *d_k is in omega, then we set x_k+1 = x_k  + alpha_k *d_k as  usual. IF, on the other hand, it is not in omega, then we 'project' it back into omega before setting x_k+1. 
    * the point II(x) is called the projection of x onto omega. Note that II(x) is actually the 'cloest' point in omega to x. 
    * in some cases, there is a formula for computing II(X). In general, even if the projection II is well defined, the computation of II(X) given x may not be easy. Often the project II(X) may have to be computed numerically. However, the numerical computation II(X) itself entails solving an optimisation algorithm. Indeed, the computation of II(X) may be as  difficult as the original optimisation problem. 

- projected gradient methods

the projection operator II using the orthogonal projector

    * the projected version of the gradient algorithm has the form: x_k+1 = II[x_k - alpha_k * reverse_triange f(x_k)]  
       or II [x_k - alpha_k * reverse_triange f(x_k)] = x_k - alpha_k * P * reverse_triange f(x_k)
    * this projection is equivalent to multiplication by the matrix P
    * a well-know variant of the projected gradient algorithm is the projected steepest descent algorithm},

the method of steepest descent uses only first derivatives (gradients) in selecting a suitable search direction. This strategy is not always the most effective. 

Newton's method (sometimes called the Newton-Raphson method) uses first and second derivatives and indeed does perform better than the steepest descent method if the initial point is close to the minimiser. 

Given a starting point, we construct a quadratic approximation to the objective function that matches the first and second derivative values at that point. We then minimise the approximate (quadratic) function instead of the original objective function. We use the minimise of the approximate function as the starting point in the next step and repeat the procedure iteratively. 

The quadratic approximation to the given twich continuously differentiable objection function is obtained using the Taylor series expansion of f about the current point, neglecting terms of order three and higher.},

  comment      = {One way to solve a constrained optimisation problem is to add each constraint to the objective function and wrap each constraint in a step function. If the constraint is satisfied, then the step function value is zero, otherwise is positive infinite. 

However, this modified objective function is very hard to solve as the step function is both non-differentiable and discontinuous. So we will replace the step function as a linear function --- multipling each constraint with a lumda instead. This new modified objective function is the Lagrangian. When we take the maximum with the respect to lumda of this Lagrangian function we have the orginial modified function. 

The original modified function will become minimise over x and then maximise over  lumda. Though this is very hard to solve. Though we can reverse the order to become maximise over lumda and then minmiise over x. This minimise over x given a lumda is known as the dual function and maxmimising the dual function is known as the dual problem. The dual problem is a concave function and the constraints are linear , so maxximising the dual function over lumda is a convex optiimisation problem. 

Then solution to the dual poroblem is less or equal to the optimal solution of the original primal problem. When strong duality holds, the optimial gap is zero and therefore then solutions to the dual and the primal problems are the same.},

This paper aims to establish a decentralized system-wide framework to coordinate demand response of residential customers in a smart grid.

Home load management (HLM) modules, embedded in customers' smart meters are autonomous agents of the framework. The energy service provider iteratively exchanges load information with HLM modules in the hope of achieving his desired load profile. In each iteration, the service provider announces system load profile to HLM modules. The modules, keeping in mind their own financial and comfort constraints, nonsequentially send back load reschedule proposals to modify system load profile. The received proposals are judged whether they improve system load profile or not. HLM modules with accepted proposals apply their proposed schedules. The modified system load profile is then released, and HLM modules' new proposals are gathered and judged. This procedure is repeated to the point at which no further improvement in the system load profile can be experienced. Performance of the framework is shown by applying it to a system with 50 customers.},

  pages     = {1-6},
  abstract  = {Due to steady urbanization, the electrical grid is facing significant changes in the supply of resources as well as changes in the type, scale, and patterns of residential user demand. To ensure sustainability and reliability of electricity provision in the growing cities, a significant increase in energy generated from renewable sources (e.g., wind, solar) is required. However, renewable energy supply is much more variable and intermittent than traditional supply, as it depends on changing weather conditions. In order to optimize residential energy usage, demand response (DR) techniques are being investigated to shift device usage to the periods of low demand. Currently most DR approaches focus on traditional DR goals, e.g., reducing usage at peak times and increasing it at off-peak times. More flexible and adaptive techniques are needed that can not only meet traditional DR requirements, but enable just-in-time use of renewable energy, rather than requiring its curtailment or using expensive and inefficient storage options. This paper proposes the use of decentralized learning-based multi-agent residential DR to enable more efficient integration of renewable energy sources in the smart grid, in the presence of increased demand caused by high electric vehicle penetration. We evaluate the approach using real household usage data obtained from Irish smart meter trials and data on wind-generated energy from the Irish grid operator. We discuss advantages of the proposed decentralized approach and show that it is able to respond to multiple variable wind-generation patterns by shifting up to 35% of the overall energy usage to the periods of high wind availability.},

Specifically, each household may have renewable generation, energy storage as well as inelastic and elastic energy loads, and the load serving entity attempts to coordinate the energy consumption of these households in order to minimize the total energy cost within this neighborhood. The renewable generation, the energy demand arrival, and the energy cost function are all stochastic processes and evolve according to some, possibly unknown, probabilistic laws. We develop an online control algorithm, called Lyapunov-based cost minimization algorithm (LCMA), which jointly considers the energy management and demand management decisions. LCMA only needs to keep track of the current values of the underlying stochastic processes without requiring any knowledge of their statistics. Moreover, a decentralized algorithm to implement LCMA is also developed, which can preserve the privacy of individual household owners. Numerical results based on real-world trace data show that our control algorithm can effectively reduce the total energy cost in the neighborhood.},

  abstract = {For effective engagement of residential demand-side resources and to ensure efficient operation of distribution networks, we must overcome the challenges of controlling and coordinating residential components and devices at scale. To overcome this challenge, we present a distributed and scalable algorithm with a three-level hierarchical information exchange architecture for managing the residential demand response programs. First, a centralized optimization model is formulated to maximize community social welfare. Then, this centralized model is solved in a distributed manner with alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) by decomposing the original problem to utility-level and house-level problems. The information exchange between the different layers is limited to the primary residual (i.e., supply-demand mismatch), Lagrangian multipliers, and the total load of each house to protect each customer’s privacy. Simulation studies are performed on the IEEE 33 bus test system with 605 residential customers. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can save customers’ electricity bills and reduce the peak load at the utility level without much affecting customers’ comfort and privacy. Finally, a quantitative comparison of the distributed and centralized algorithms shows the scalability advantage of the proposed ADMM-based approach, and it gives benchmarking results with achievable value for future research works.},

The users are equipped with renewable energy resources (RESs), energy storage system (ESSs) and different types of smart loads. With the proposed method, each user finds an optimal operation routine in response to the varying electricity prices according to his/her own preference individually, for example, the power reduction of flexible loads, the start time of shift-able loads, the operation power of schedulable loads, and the charge/discharge routine of the ESSs. Moreover, in the method a penalty term is used to avoid large fluctuation of the user&rsquo;s operation routines in two consecutive iteration steps. In addition, unlike traditional energy management methods which neglect the forecast errors, the proposed DMPC method can adapt the operation routine to newly updated data. The DMPC is compared with a frequently used method, namely, a day-ahead programming-based method (denoted as DDA). Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and flexibility of the DMPC over the DDA method.},

Algorithm
- penalty cost per consumer: a penalty cost is added to each consumer, that penalises large fluctuant of the operation routine in two successive iterations
- a weight is assigned to the penalty cost and this weight is calculated dynamically at each iteration
- this weight has an auxilliary coefficient, used for adjusting the convergence speed of the algorithm
	= require runing. otherwise may not converge or take too long
- iteration: repeat
	* utility send the buying and selling prices to consumer
	* consumers update their schedule, and send the buying and selling power schedule back to the utility
	* until convergence
- MPC, at each time interval, repeat the iteration, only take the decision at the first time interval

Experiment
- four users, each has wind and PV generators, ESS unit and different kinds of loads
	= 8 shiftabble per user
	= assume that the demand of flexible load is 30% of the base load in each period
- 24 hourly intervals
- historical data of base load, wind and PV generation for each user is collected and modified from Belgium's transmission system
- each consumer: use CPLEX, MATLAB2013a and YALMIP toolbox

Results:
- compare with sequential (cooperative game theoratic methods) 
	* sequential: take 11 iterations per users, so 44 in total for four users
	* theirs, 12 iterations, in parallel
	* peak of theirs is a bit higher than that of sequential

Specifically, the utility does not know the cost function of consumers and cannot have multiple rounds of information exchange with consumers. We formulate an optimization problem for the utility to minimize its operational cost considering time-varying DR targets and responses of consumers. We develop a joint online learning and pricing algorithm. In each time slot, the utility sends out a price signal to all consumers and estimates the cost functions of consumers based on their noisy responses. We measure the performance of our algorithm using regret analysis and show that our online algorithm achieves logarithmic regret with respect to the operating horizon. In addition, our algorithm employs linear regression to estimate the aggregate response of consumers, making it easy to implement in practice. Simulation experiments validate the theoretic results and show that the performance gap between our algorithm and the offline optimality decays quickly.},

  abstract = {Grid modernization through philosophies such as the Smart Grid has the potential to meet increasing demand and integrate new distributed generation resources at the same time. Using advanced communication and computing capabilities, the Smart Grid offers a new avenue of controlling end-user assets, including small units such as home appliances. To enable such evolution, shifting from centralized to decentralized control strategies is required. Effective demand-side management (DSM) and demand response (DR) approaches hold the promise for efficient energy management in homes and neighborhood areas, by enabling the precise control of resources to reduce net demand. However, with such strategies, independently taken decisions can cause undesired effects such as rebound peaks, contingencies, and instabilities in the network. Therefore, the interactions between the energy management actions of multiple households is a challenging issue in the Smart Grid. This paper provides a review of the background of residential load modeling with DR and DSM approaches in a single household and concepts of coordinating mechanisms in a neighborhood area. The objective of this paper is to classify, via comparison, the various coordination structures and techniques from recent research. The results of recent research in the field reveal that the coordination of energy management in multiple households can benefit both the utility (i.e., the service provider) and the customer. The paper concludes with a discussion on the prevalent critical issues in this area.},

In our proposed optimization model, a time-varying load constraint is introduced to better capture the consumption variation of customers and hence gives our approach an adaptive feature as well as facilitates DR. Then our approach enables all generation and demand units to actively collaborate in a distributed manner to obtain the optimal electric price and their optimal power updates in real-time while achieving their best profits. To do so, the total welfare in the grid is maximized and the optimization problem is analytically solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers and consensus theory for multi-agent systems. Moreover, the power balance constraint is guaranteed in every iteration of the proposed algorithm. Next, the effects of renewable energy to conventional generation, consumer consumption, and electric price are theoretically revealed which show the essential role of renewable energy for peak load shifting.

  abstract = {Demand side management (DSM) plays an important role in smart grid for paving the way to a low-carbon future. In this paper, a hierarchical day-ahead DSM model is proposed, where renewable energy sources are integrated. The proposed model consists of three layers: the utility in the upper layer, the demand response (DR) aggregator in the middle layer, and customers in the lower layer. The utility seeks to minimize the operation cost and give part of the revenue to the DR aggregator as a bonus. The DR aggregator acts as an intermediary, receiving bonus from the utility and giving compensation to customers for modifying their energy usage pattern. The aim of the DR aggregator is to maximize its net benefit. Customers desire to maximize the social welfare, i.e., the received compensation minus the dissatisfactory level. To achieve these objectives, a multiobjective problem is formulated. An artificial immune algorithm is used to solve this problem, leading to a Pareto optimal set. Using a selection criterion, a Pareto optimal solution can be selected, which does not favour any particular participant to ensure the overall fairness. Simulation results confirm the feasibility of the proposed method: The utility can reduce the operation cost and the peak to average ratio; the DR aggregator can make a profit for providing DSM services; and customers can reduce their bill.},

  abstract   = {Many problems of recent interest in statistics and machine learning can be posed in the framework of convex optimization. Due to the explosion in size and complexity of modern datasets, it is increasingly important to be able to solve problems with a very large number of features or training examples. As a result, both the decentralized collection or storage of these datasets as well as accompanying distributed solution methods are either necessary or at least highly desirable. In this review, we argue that the alternating direction method of multipliers is well suited to distributed convex optimization, and in particular to large-scale problems arising in statistics, machine learning, and related areas. The method was developed in the 1970s, with roots in the 1950s, and is equivalent or closely related to many other algorithms, such as dual decomposition, the method of multipliers, Douglas–Rachford splitting, Spingarn's method of partial inverses, Dykstra's alternating projections, Bregman iterative algorithms for ℓ1 problems, proximal methods, and others. After briefly surveying the theory and history of the algorithm, we discuss applications to a wide variety of statistical and machine learning problems of recent interest, including the lasso, sparse logistic regression, basis pursuit, covariance selection, support vector machines, and many others. We also discuss general distributed optimization, extensions to the nonconvex setting, and efficient implementation, including some details on distributed MPI and Hadoop MapReduce implementations.},

  abstract = {The recent rapid uptake of residential solar photovoltaic installations provides many challenges for electricity distribution networks designed for one-way power flow from the generator to residential customers via transmission and distribution networks. For grid-connected installations, large amounts of generation during low load periods or intermittent generation can lead to a difficulty in balancing supply and demand, maintaining voltage and frequency stability, and may even result in outages due to overvoltage conditions tripping protection circuits. In this paper, we present four control methodologies to mitigate these difficulties using small-scale distributed battery storage. These four approaches represent three different control architectures: 1) centralized; 2) decentralized; and 3) distributed control. These approaches are validated and compared using data on load and generation profiles from customers in an Australian electricity distribution network.},
  comment  = {Abstract
- challenge:
	1) rapid uptake of residential PV installation => 
		large amount of generation during low load periods + intermittent generation => 
		degradation of power quality, even outages due to overvoltage conditions
- solutions: 
	1) centralised, 2) decentralsied, 3) distributed

Introduction
- challenge:
	1) dramatic worldwide growth in PV distributed generation => 
		reverse power flow in the low-voltage network during day time + low residential load => 
		increases in distribution feeder voltages (voltage rise problem), + potential for adverse impacts on power quality and the safety of customer-owned devices
- solution
	1) distributed battery sotrage, consideing by utilities to a) reinforce distribution networks and b) shave peak demand without large-scale capital costs for feeder replacement and related network upgrades
	2) peak demand shifting, sought by consumers to reduce costs by shifting electricity purchases away from times of peak tariffs
	* though currently the capital cost of battery systems is high, the battery costs are expected to fall and deployment of residential energy storage systems largely will be possible
	3) proposal: a) simple controller, b) centralised, c) decentralised and d) distributed

Model
- market maker
	1) set prices for buying and selling iteratively with a view of minimising the aggregate impacts of batteries on the distribution grid
	2) communicates with batteries
- small neighbourhood-level network with several residences
	1) each household has a) inelastic load, b) on-site generation, like PV panels, and c) battery
- time: 30 minute interval

Method
- simple controller
	1) rule-based,
	2) independent
	3) charge when generation > load and discharge otherwise
- centralised:
	1) flatten the aggregate demand profile
	2) objective: minimise the difference between the anticipated average usage of all households (without the battery) and the anticipated average usage with the battery (??)
	3) problem: computation cost increases significantly with the problem size (cannot solve 300 households) + full knowledge of the network required and update the the knowledge when there is any change
- decentraslied
	1) penalise the deviations from its anticipated average usage of a single household
	2) problem: independent (no communication between households and between the households and the market maker, unlikely to lead to, or even approach network-wide optimal behaviour
- distribributed (novel in their opinions)
	1) each battery communicates with the market maker
	2) goal: flatten the aggregate power usag eof the network
	3) use a selling price and a buying price per time interval
	4) objective each household: minimise the cost of buying minus the income from selling
	5) the market maker set buying prices using a method that they did not name it.... or refer to anything else...., the selling price is a fraction of the buying price, so buying is always more expensive than selling at any time interval
		* a selectable parameter is used without being explained clearly
	3) linear optimisation problem
	4) iterative communication between the market maker and the households until a steady state is reached

Simulation
- four sythetic power profile and then a group of 20 and 300 households derived from the smart grid and smart city data from Ausgrid
- Centralised > distributed (slightly) >  decentralised > simpjle controller in most cases (tiny)> no batteries in most cases
- Centralised doesn't work on 300 households --- cannot solve it.

Thoughts
- the maths were not well and clearly explained, especially the convergence and the pricing method},

This paper investigates joint scheduling problem of large-scale smart appliances and batteries (e.g., in a smart building), to minimize electricity payment, user's dissatisfaction and battery loss under kinds of constraints. Due to the binary nature of charge and discharge states of battery, this problem is formulated as a constrained mixed-integer nonlinear program. In order to solve it efficiently, a distributed mixed optimization approach is proposed. First, Lagrangian relaxation is applied to decompose the original problem into two sets of subproblems, each of which corresponds to scheduling on appliance/battery. Then, the battery scheduling subproblem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and tackled by Benders decomposition. The main advantages of the proposed approach are the distributed implementation and low computational complexity, as shown by simulations.},

As the household appliances contribute significantly to the energy consumption of the smart houses, it is possible to decrease electricity cost in buildings by scheduling the operation of domestic appliances. In this paper, we propose an optimization model for jointly minimizing electricity costs and CO2 emissions by considering consumer preferences in smart buildings that are equipped with distributed energy resources (DERs). Both controllable and uncontrollable tasks and DER operations are scheduled according to the real-time price of electricity and a peak demand charge to reduce the peak demand on the grid. We formulate the daily energy consumption scheduling problem in multiple smart homes from economic and environmental perspectives and exploit a mixed integer linear programming technique to solve it. We validated the proposed approach through extensive experimental analysis. The results of the experiment show that the proposed approach can decrease both CO2 emissions and the daily energy cost.},

  abstract  = {Reducing peak demand is an important part of ongoing smart grid research efforts. To reduce peak demand, utilities are introducing variable rate electricity prices. Recent efforts have shown how variable rate pricing can incentivize consumers to use energy storage to cut their electricity bill, by storing energy during inexpensive off-peak periods and using it during expensive peak periods. Unfortunately, variable rate pricing provides only a weak incentive for distributed energy storage and does not promote its adoption at scale. In this paper, we present the storage adoption cycle to describe the issues with incentivizing energy storage using variable rates. We then propose a simple way to address the issues: augment variable rate pricing with a surcharge based on a consumer's peak demand.The surcharge encourages consumers to flatten their demand, rather shift as much demand as possible to the low-price period. We present PeakCharge, which includes a new peak-aware charging algorithm to optimize the use of energy storage in the presence of a peak demand surcharge, and use a closed-loop simulator to quantify its ability to flatten grid demand as the use of energy storage scales. We show that our system i) reduces upfront capital costs since it requires significantly less storage capacity per consumer than prior approaches, ii) increases energy storage's ROI, since the surcharge mitigates free riding and maintains the incentive to use energy storage at scale, and iii) uses aggregate storage capacity within 18% of an optimal centralized system.},

Distributed economic dispatch for a microgrid with high renewable energy penetration and demand-side management operating in grid-connected mode is considered in this paper. To address the intrinsically stochastic availability of renewable energy sources (RES), a novel power scheduling approach is introduced. The approach involves the actual renewable energy as well as the energy traded with the main grid, so that the supply-demand balance is maintained. The optimal scheduling strategy minimizes the microgrid net cost, which includes DG and DS costs, utility of dispatchable loads, and worst-case transaction cost stemming from the uncertainty in RES. Leveraging the dual decomposition, the optimization problem formulated is solved in a distributed fashion by the local controllers of DG, DS, and dispatchable loads. Numerical results are reported to corroborate the effectiveness of the novel approach.},

These programs are tailored to offer monetary incentives to electricity customers so that they voluntarily consume electricity in an efficient way. Thus, DSM presents households with numerous opportunities to lower their electricity bills. However, systems that combine the various DSM strategies with a view to maximizing energy management benefits have not received sufficient attention. This study therefore proposes an intelligent energy management framework that can be used to implement both energy storage and appliance scheduling schemes. By adopting appliance scheduling, customers can realize cost savings by appropriately scheduling their power consumption during the low peak hours. More savings could further be achieved through smart electricity storage. Power storage allows electricity consumers to purchase power during off-peak hours when electricity prices are low and satisfy their demands when prices are high by discharging the batteries. For optimal cost savings, the customers must constantly monitor the price fluctuations in order to determine when to switch between the utility grid and the electricity storage devices. However, with a high penetration of consumer owned storage devices, the charging of the batteries must be properly coordinated and appropriately scheduled to avoid creating new peaks. This paper therefore proposes an autonomous smart charging framework that ensures both the stability of the power grid and customer savings.},

In order to compensate for the short-term fluctuation of wind energy, deployment of energy storage (ES) units in various types have been introduced as a viable solution. This paper develops a stochastic mathematical model for the optimal allocation of ES units in active distribution networks (ADNs) in order to reduce wind power spillage and load curtailment while managing congestion and voltages deviation. Nonlinearities of the original formulation are converted to linear equivalents and the final model lies within the computationally tractable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) fashion. The IEEE 33-bus 12.66 kV radial distribution test system is utilized to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. It was found that the rated power and capacity of ES units are depends on wind units' location and penetration level, in such a way that ES units are allocated near wind units to absorb excessive wind energy as much as possible. Furthermore, the results indicate ES units are useful for other purposes such as voltage management issue even if the wind units are not allocated.},

  abstract  = {Recent development of renewable generation and increasing penetration of electric vehicles have led to large volumes of residential battery storage systems connected at distribution networks. In this paper, we propose a control algorithm for residential batteries that determines optimal day-ahead battery scheduling and operation with the aim to minimize household energy bills and in the context of dynamic Time of Use (ToU) electricity tariffs. The proposed formulation of the optimization problem takes into consideration the battery's depreciation cost, which is determined by the accurate enumeration of battery cycles, including partial cycling i.e. battery cycles that do not start or end at 100% of State of Charge (SoC). A key advantage of the proposed formulation is that the problem can be solvable by use of linear programming. In addition, we study and compare the benefits of the optimisation-based algorithm with lifespan consideration to a simple heuristic-based battery control scheme and an optimisation-based algorithm without battery lifecycle consideration. Results show that battery lifespan consideration in the optimization algorithm does not necessarily yield to lower prosumer energy bills, when compared to other approaches, but it can lead to a lower depreciation cost of the battery.},
  comment   = {Background:
- electric grids are facing important challenges due to the increasing penetration of distributed intermittent generation and electricity consumption at a residential level caused by electric vehicles and electric-based heating systems
- one solution for safe grid management is local battery storage
- electrochemical battery costs are projected to fail
- key research area, the development of smart battery control and scheduling that aims to  optimise the revenues and services a battery can provide.


Contribution:
- extension of the optimisation problem formulation, such that the battery cycle life is included in the optimisation problem
- study the impact of optimal battery control with lifespan considertaion on prosumer revenues and compare this with a heuristic control method and an optimisation-based control without considertaion of battery lifespan


Heuristic-based battery control algorithm:
- the control algorithm relies on If... Then... rules, based on the difference between the household power consumption and the PV production. 


Optimisation-based battery control algorithm without lifespan consideration
- MILP implementation
- the cost for using the battery is not considered
- 48 thirty-minute intervals for scheduling (and pricing?)
- prices:
	= selling prices
	= buying prices
- objective:
	= cost - revenue, given known prices
- model:
	= maximum capacity of energy that household can inject to or consume by the grid
	= minimum and maximum battery capacity
	= maximum power from the b attery (corresponding to the maximum C-rate)
	= charging and discharging efficiencies


Optimisation-based battery control algorithm with lifespan consideration
- considers the impact of the number of charge/discharge cycles on the battery life
- existing work uses well konwn techniques for extraction of partial cycling, such as the Rainflow counting algorithm, for formulate the optimisation, but would lead to a highyl non linear problem that could only be solved by more complex algorithms such as population based algorithms. 
- this paper proposes an approach that computes linearly the cost of each half cycle experienced by the battery
	= the cycle cost for a 10kWh battery with a price of 250$ per kWh for the battery cells
- objective:
	= cost - revenues + battery cost
	= the battery cost function is a linear function of the depth of discharge once the discharging half cycle is compled (at the end of each time interval I presume?)
	= the cost per cycle is the slope of this linear function


Experiment
- setup:
	= a solar PV system
	= a battery storage
	= a household
- data:
	= half-hourly consumption and production data of a real household participating in the ReFLEX demonstrator project were used
	= ToU tariffs from a paper for electriocity prices (selling prices are lower than the buying prices)
- implementation:
	= CVX matlab and MOSEK solver
- result:
	= the lowest bill is obtained with the optimisation-based algorithm without lifespan consideration and a long time horizon (a week assuming perfect forecast)
	= the heuristic-based algorithm also demonstrates a significant reduction in the energy bill 
	= the control algorithm with consideration of the battery lifespan does not provide as much benefit in terms of energy bill reduction, due to the small time horizon for the optimisation (??)
	= they computed the annual depreciation cost of the battery by the use of the Rainflow algorithm. The proposed scheme decreases the depreciation cost of the battery, but only by a small amount when compared to the approach without lifespan consideration, due to the smaller cost for battery cycling.
- conclusion:
	= considering lifespan reduced the depreciation cost but did not reduce the saving that much (hmmmm.... but depended on many things...)},

  abstract  = {Reducing our reliance on carbon-intensive energy sources is vital for reducing the carbon footprint of the electric grid. Although the grid is seeing increasing deployments of clean, renewable sources of energy, a significant portion of the grid demand is still met using traditional carbon-intensive energy sources. In this paper, we study the problem of using energy storage deployed in the grid to reduce the grid's carbon emissions. While energy storage has previously been used for grid optimizations such as peak shaving and smoothing intermittent sources, our insight is to use distributed storage to enable utilities to reduce their reliance on their less efficient and most carbon-intensive power plants and thereby reduce their overall emission footprint. We formulate the problem of emission-aware scheduling of distributed energy storage as an optimization problem, and use a robust optimization approach that is well-suited for handling the uncertainty in load predictions, especially in the presence of intermittent renewables such as solar and wind. We evaluate our approach using a state of the art neural network load forecasting technique and real load traces from a distribution grid with 1,341 homes. Our results show a reduction of &gt;0.5 million kg in annual carbon emissions --- equivalent to a drop of 23.3% in our electric grid emissions.},

  abstract       = {This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework for solving battery scheduling problems in order to extend the lifetime of batteries used in electrical vehicles (EVs), cellular phones, and embedded systems. Battery pack lifetime has often been the limiting factor in many of today&rsquo;s smart systems, from mobile devices and wireless sensor networks to EVs. Smart charge-discharge scheduling of battery packs is essential to obtain super linear gain of overall system lifetime, due to the recovery effect and nonlinearity in the battery characteristics. Additionally, smart scheduling has also been shown to be beneficial for optimizing the system&rsquo;s thermal profile and minimizing chances of irreversible battery damage. The recent rapidly-growing community and development infrastructure have added deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to the available tools for designing battery management systems. Through leveraging the representation powers of deep neural networks and the flexibility and versatility of reinforcement learning, DRL offers a powerful solution to both roofline analysis and real-world deployment on complicated use cases. This work presents a DRL-based battery scheduling framework to solve battery scheduling problems, with high flexibility to fit various battery models and application scenarios. Through the discussion of this framework, comparisons have also been made between conventional heuristics-based methods and DRL. The experiments demonstrate that DRL-based scheduling framework achieves battery lifetime comparable to the best weighted-k round-robin (kRR) heuristic scheduling algorithm. In the meantime, the framework offers much greater flexibility in accommodating a wide range of battery models and use cases, including thermal control and imbalanced battery.},

  abstract       = {Flexible distributed energy resources, such as energy storage systems (ESSs), are increasingly considered as means for mitigating challenges introduced by the integration of stochastic, variable distributed generation (DG). The optimal operation of a distribution system with ESS can be formulated as a multi-period optimal power flow (MPOPF) problem which involves scheduling of the charging/discharging of the ESS over an extended planning horizon, e.g., for day-ahead operational planning. Although such problems have been the subject of many works in recent years, these works very rarely consider uncertainties in DG, and almost never explicitly consider uncertainties beyond the current operational planning horizon. This article presents a framework of methods and models for accounting for uncertainties due to distributed wind and solar photovoltaic power generation beyond the planning horizon in an AC MPOPF model for distribution systems with ESS. The expected future value of energy stored at the end of the planning horizon is determined as a function of the stochastic DG resource variables and is explicitly included in the objective function. Results for a case study based on a real distribution system in Norway demonstrate the effectiveness of an operational strategy for ESS scheduling accounting for DG uncertainties. The case study compares the application of the framework to wind and solar power generation. Thus, this work also gives insight into how different approaches are appropriate for modeling DG uncertainty for these two forms of variable DG, due to their inherent differences in terms of variability and stochasticity.},

  abstract = {The integration of renewable energy sources together with an energy storage system into a distribution network has become essential not only to maintain continuous electricity supply but also to minimise electricity costs. The operational costs of this paradigm depend highly upon the optimal use of battery energy. This paper proposes day-ahead scheduling of the battery energy while considering its degradation costs due to charging-discharging cycles. The degradation costs with respect to the depth of charge are modelled and added to the objective function to determine the actual operational costs of the system. A framework to solve the function is developed in which particle swarm optimisation, the Rainflow algorithm and scenario techniques are integrated. Uncertainties of parameters, modelled by scenario generation and reduced by scenario reduction techniques, are discussed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the operational costs by around 40% compared to the baseline method. They also reveal that uncertainty in power generation and power demand has no influence on the energy schedule of the battery, but variation in electricity prices has an impact on the outcome. Several pragmatic tests verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},
  comment  = {Abstract:
- integration of renewable energy sources together with an energy storage system into a distribution network has become essential not only to maintain continuous electricity supply but also oto mininmise electricity costs
- the degradation cost with respect to the depth of charge are modelled
- reduce the operational costs by around 40\% compared to the baselin method. 
- uncertainty in power generation and power demand has no influence on the energy schedule of the battery, but variation in electricity prices (!!)


Background:
- increasing penetration of RESs into an existing distribution netowrk is a driving force to develop a microgrid as an intelligent and modern power system. 
	= high uncertainty in generating renewable power
- RTP pricing:
	= with REWs power, it becomse essential to consider dynamic pricing schemes, such as RTP that is often announced hours ahead by the network operators, helping users with schedule flexible loads. 
- battery integration:
	= deal with the uncertainty
	= provide mismatch energy in the microgrid
	= store and export energy to provide ancillary services and financial benefits to investors, depending upon user demand. 
- gap:
	= although various objective functions with constraints are developed, their explicit impacts on the system, especially degradation costs of a battery and its optimal energy, are not demonstrated. 
	= exsiting traditional optimisation techniques could not solve this complex problem with a real degradation cost function


Microgrid:
- grid-tied mode
	= can exchange with the grid utility to reduce operational costs
- 15 houses
	= critical loads, preducted
	= non-critical loads 
	= the peak demand of a household is about 2.2 kW
- ESS
	= 40 kW (sufficient to meet the peak demand for at least an hour)
	= SOC: 20% ~ 90%
- RESs
	= 40 kW wind generation
	= 35 kW solar PV
	= solar irradiation and wind velocity profiles, forecasted

Model:
- solar generation: a linear function of solar irradiation
	= solar irradiation (require forecasts)
	= overall efficiency and area of PV panels
	= outside air temperature
	= temperature coefficient of the maximum output power (depending on the PV technology and manufacturing parameters)
	= total output power of all panels: linear function
- wind turbine: depends on wind velocities, a piece-wise function of the wind speed
	= rated electrical power
	= rated wind speed
	= wind speed (require forecasts)
	= cut-in wind speed
	= cut-off wind speed
	= total output power of all turbines: linear function
- loads
	= maximum load is around 2.2 kW
	= fluctuating with the time sterp of 1h
	= load patterns are considered the same for all households (diversie load profiles will not unalter the conclusions drawn form experiments)
- utility grid
	= RTP
	= sell price and the buy prices are considered the same for this analysis
- storage systems
	= Li-ion batteries, higher energy-to-weight ratios, a slow loss of charge during idel conditions and no memory effect)
	= linear SOC function
	= maximum charge and discharge rates
	= charge and discharge efficiencies (considered as unity for simplicity)
	= maxinimum and minimum energy levels

Objective function:
- generation management: minimise electricity cost
- battery management: minimise degradation cost ===> it might not be easy to understand this
	= with respect to the depth of discharge (DoD), and 
	= the life loss of the battery over the time period, for counted cycles of depth, determined by applying the Rainflow algorithm
	= total life loss of N number of cyclaes: linear function
	= cycle depth stress function
		* the number of cycles with depth d, counted by the Rainflow algorithm
		* the depth of a cycle's amplitude determined by the algorithm
		* the slopovalue of the battery degradation curve taken from the battery sheets
		* the total number of given cycles for the battery
		* exponential relationship between cycle life loss and depth of discharge
	= two types of degradation
		* self (calendar fade):  corrosion of internal materials, constant
		* cycle: related to the working modes of the battery
		* cycling cost = total investiment cost - self degradation cost
- constraints
 	= energy balance
	= battery energy: 
		* charging and discharging rates, 
		* energy levels

Solution (not quite clear how they work together):
- Rainflow algorithm
	= determines battery degradation costs during the search process
- particle swarm 
	= optimisation optimises the new proposed model
- uncertainties: 
	= represented in the form of scenarios
	= each scenario represents a distinct input of the optimisation model
	= scenario reduction technique to use a small number of effective scenarios
- day-ahead scheduling procedure:
	1. load data of wind speed, price, solar irradiation and load profile  
	2. generate scenarios to represent uncertainty in RESs and RTP prices
	3. compute the total solar power, wind power and loads; 
	4. initialise PSO (position and velocity vectora for all particles randomly between the limits)
	6. initial energy levels for the battery
	7. apply the rainflow algorithm to determine the total number of cycles and their amplitudes
	8. estimate the damage to the battery
	9. evalute the cost function to find fitness value for the scheduling imte
	10. iteration
		* initiailise the positions and velocities again after the first run
		* modifify the positions and velocities
		* calculate avaialbe battery energy for the forecasting horizon
		* repeat  7 - 9
		* synthesise the global best and individual best values by comparing costs
	11. comtinue the steps from 10 until the termination criterion is fulfilled. 
- Matlab


Data:
- hourly data of wind speed, price, solar irradiation and load profile
	= one set of data for each considered scenario
- scenario generation: scenarios with a normal distribution over the time period are generated based on:
		* mean values that depend on forecasting values and standard deviation, depends on the historical errors
- 40 kWh battery size


Experiemtns:
- interesting, when degradation cost is considered, the uncertainties in power generation had little impacts on the battery schedule. 

Thoughts:
- rainflow counting algorithm is used in the analysis of fatigue data in order to reduce a spectrum of varying stress into an equivalent set of simple stress reversals (from wiki)
	= I am not familiar with this algorithm and this paper doesn't explain why this can be applied to counting battery cycles from a SoC profile.
- the scenario generation and reduction techniques discussed in this paper is interesting.},

  abstract = {Battery energy storage is becoming an important part of modern power systems. As such, its operation model needs to be integrated in the state-of-the-art market clearing, system operation, and investment models. However, models that commonly represent operation of a large-scale battery energy storage are inaccurate. A major issue is that they ignore the dependence of the charging power on the battery state of energy. Consequently, market players might suffer great monetary losses for not being able to follow their day-ahead schedule and/or deliver the scheduled reserves. In order to bridge the gap between very detailed low-level battery charging constraints and high-level battery operation models used in the literature, this paper examines a dependence of battery charging ability on its state of energy. It proposes a laboratory procedure, which can be used for any battery type and technology, to obtain this dependence. It also formulates an accurate linear battery charging model, which closely approximates the real-life battery charging constraints. The proposed battery charging model is compared against the models commonly used in the literature. Battery operation schedules obtained by all the models are compared against experimentally obtained results in order to assess the value of the proposed model in real life.},

This requires repeated scheduling of the energy storage charging schedule in advance, across a finite future horizon. When forecasts and degradation models are incorporated, optimal solutions can become expensive to compute. Local conditions, however, can change instantly, and require fast response by local controllers to truly maximise the energy storage system's returned value. This work proposes a method for optimally operating energy storage in response to multiple value streams that finds the optimal solution over a future horizon, and then breaks this down into a schedule for a small set of simple, local, rule-based controllers. Each local controller is set up to maximise one particular value stream, and can respond to changing conditions on a timescale of milliseconds. The method is specifically designed for implementation on real systems, and successful at ensuring a near-optimal value return by the energy storage system.},

  abstract  = {As a result of growing markets for electric vehicles and residential batteries for buffering energy from photovoltaics, the number of grid-integrated lithium-ion batteries has been continuously increasing in the past years. Apart from their primary purpose, these batteries may also be employed to provide services to the power grid in terms of peak shaving or frequency regulation. The profitability of such services for the battery owner, however, remains a controversial issue. Particularly battery degradation resulting from increased energy throughput is discussed as a major impediment for profitable operation. This paper presents a scheduling approach which considers the non-linear dependencies of battery aging from various operation parameters along with real-time prices and price forecasts for computing optimal charging/dispatching schedules. The methodology is applied to price-data obtained from four different electricity markets. The investigation partly confirms existing profitability concerns but further shows that explicit consideration of battery degradation can yield profitable outcomes. Various scenarios using aggregated and locational marginal prices as well as different forecasting horizons and time resolutions are explored to identify favorable operating conditions.},
  comment   = {Background:
- doubts over economic profitability of using batteries, degradation, overcompensate revenues
- decreasing prices of lithium-ion batteries can be expected to foster the sales of both plug-in electric vehicles and small-scale home batteries to private households. 
- Grid integrated batteries may also be employed to provide services to the power grid.
- distributed energy storage could serve for shaving load peaks, filling load valleys, and balancing frequency fluctuations, thus facilitating the integration of renewable energies and mitigating possible grid congestion caused by uncontrolled PEV charging. 

Gap:
- the static limitation of a battery's operation range without an underlying model makes the restriction somewhat arbitrary and therefore does not lead to an optimal outcome. 
- this paper presetns a study employing battery storage for energy arbitrage in four different real-time markets.
- the objective is to provide an insight into conditions under which energy arbitrage using small-scale batteries can be profitable. 

Cost:
- revenue: discharge from battery to grid
- cost: charge from grid to battery
- price: purchase
- degradation cost (decrease of capacity and a power fade, resulting from calendar aging and cycling of energy):
	= aging depends on C-rate, SOC, delta SOC, temperature and humidity. 
	= decrease of the normalised capacity as a function of the accumulated charge thoughout 
	= cost per cycled unit of energy

Battery model:
- efficiencies: discharge from battery to grid, charge from grid to battery
- soc: min and max
- charge/discharge rates: maximum
- SOC function
- C-rate: 1C

Method:
- dynamic programming:
	= non-linear dependency of battery costs from the operation parameters

Data:
- prices: 
	= 30-min intervals
	= 5-minute intervals
- battery:
	= 20 kWh, 1C, 0.8 efficiency
- w/o battery (degradation) cost:
	= large SOC swings and extreme SOC states resulting in fast capacity fade
	= 1 - 2 battery replacements per year
	= a new battery would have decreased to a factor of 0.66 - 0.79 of its initial value at the end of each year
	= perform full cycles in any profitable period without planning for the next upcoming periods. 
- w degration cost:
	= ensure that energy is only cycled under conditions where revenues exceed degradation costs.
	= capacity losses further decrease to 0.98 - 0.99, meaning only small amounts of energy are cycled.
- higher time resolution: 
	= 5 min-intervals, 5 times higher than the profit resulting from an hourly resolution of price data. 
	= given current battery costs and lifetimes, geographic location and temporal resolution of price data play a major role regarding profitable operation.

Future work:
- provide ancillary services to earn reward for capacity provision in addition to energy dispatch --> though require owners to participate in real-time market and day-ahead markets, which may involve an aggregator.},

An operational strategy that aims to maximize the returned value of such a system can often be significantly improved with the use of forecasting - of demand, generation, and pricing - but consideration of battery degradation is important too. This paper proposes a stochastic dynamic programming approach to optimally operate an energy storage system across a receding horizon. The method operates an energy storage asset to deliver maximal lifetime value, by using available forecasts and by applying a multi-factor battery degradation model that takes into account operational impacts on system degradation. Applying the method to a dataset of a residential Australian customer base demonstrates that an optimally operated system returns a lifetime value which is 160% more, on average, than that of the same system operated using a set-point-based method applied in many settings today.},

In the present study, real time optimal schedule controller for HEMS is proposed using a new binary backtracking search algorithm (BBSA) to manage the energy consumption. The BBSA gives optimal schedule for home devices in order to limit the demand of total load and schedule the operation of home appliances at specific times during the day. Hardware prototype of smart sockets and graphical user interface software were designed to demonstrate the proposed HEMS and to provide the interface between loads and scheduler, respectively. A set of the most common home appliances, namely, air conditioner, water heater, refrigerator, and washing machine has been considered to be controlled. The proposed scheduling algorithm is applied under two cases in which the first case considers operation at weekday from 4 to 11 pm and the second case considers weekend at different time of the day. Experimental results of the proposed BBSA schedule controller are compared with the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) schedule controller to verify the accuracy of the developed controller in the HEMS. The BBSA schedule controller provides better results compared to that of the BPSO schedule controller in reducing the energy consumption and the total electricity bill and save the energy at peak hours of certain loads.},

  abstract = {In recent years, increasing interest in developing small-scale fully integrated energy resources in distributed power networks and their production has led to the emergence of smart Microgrids (MG), in particular for distributed renewable energy resources integrated with wind turbine, photovoltaic and energy storage assets. In this paper, a sustainable day-ahead scheduling of the grid-connected home-type Microgrids (H-MG) with the integration of non-dispatchable/dispatchable distributed energy resources and responsive load demand is co-investigated, in particular to study the simultaneously existed uncontrollable and controllable production resources despite the existence of responsive and non-responding loads. An efficient energy management system (EMS) optimization algorithm based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) (termed as EMS-MILP) using the GAMS implementation for producing power optimization with minimum hourly power system operational cost and sustainable electricity generation of within a H-MG. The day-ahead scheduling feature of electric power and energy systems shared with renewable resources as a MILP problem characteristic for solving the hourly economic dispatch-constraint unit commitment is also modelled to demonstrate the ability of an EMS-MILP algorithm for a H-MG under realistic technical constraints connected to the upstream grid. Numerical simulations highlight the effectiveness of the proposed algorithmic optimization capabilities for sustainable operations of smart H-MGs connected to a variety of global loads and resources to postulate best power economization. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show a reduction in the generated power cost by almost 21% in comparison with conventional EMS.},

  abstract       = {Energy storage systems will play a key role for individual users in the future smart grid. They serve two purposes: (i) handling the intermittent nature of renewable energy resources for a more reliable and efficient system; and (ii) preventing the impact of blackouts on users and allowing for more independence from the grid, while saving money through load-shifting. In this paper we investigate the latter scenario by looking at a neighbourhood of 25 households whose demand is satisfied by one utility company. Assuming the users possess lithium-ion batteries, we answer the question of how each household can make the best use of their individual storage system given a real-time pricing policy. To this end, each user is modelled as a player of a non-cooperative scheduling game. The novelty of the game lies in the advanced battery model, which incorporates charging and discharging characteristics of lithium-ion batteries. The action set for each player comprises day-ahead schedules of their respective battery usage. We analyse different user behaviour and are able to obtain a realistic and applicable understanding of the potential of these systems. As a result, we show the correlation between the efficiency of the battery and the outcome of the game.},

  abstract       = {Traditional power grid and its demand-side management (DSM) techniques are centralized and mainly focus on industrial consumers. The ignorance of residential and commercial sectors in DSM activities degrades the overall performance of a conventional grid. Therefore, the concept of DSM and demand response (DR) via residential sector makes the smart grid (SG) superior over the traditional grid. In this context, this paper proposes an optimized home energy management system (OHEMS) that not only facilitates the integration of renewable energy source (RES) and energy storage system (ESS) but also incorporates the residential sector into DSM activities. The proposed OHEMS minimizes the electricity bill by scheduling the household appliances and ESS in response to the dynamic pricing of electricity market. First, the constrained optimization problem is mathematically formulated by using multiple knapsack problems, and then solved by using the heuristic algorithms; genetic algorithm (GA), binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), wind driven optimization (WDO), bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) and hybrid GA-PSO (HGPO) algorithms. The performance of the proposed scheme and heuristic algorithms is evaluated via MATLAB simulations. Results illustrate that the integration of RES and ESS reduces the electricity bill and peak-to-average ratio (PAR) by 19.94% and 21.55% respectively. Moreover, the HGPO algorithm based home energy management system outperforms the other heuristic algorithms, and further reduces the bill by 25.12% and PAR by 24.88%.},

Energy efficiency of either cells or full packs is seldom documented by manufacturers in enough detail to provide an accurate impression of this metric over a range of operating conditions. The energy efficiency of a full battery pack may also be subject to more variables than would be represented by extrapolating results obtained from a single cell, and can be more demanding to measure in an accurate and consistent manner. Roundtrip energy efficiency of a 22.8-kWh A123 Li-ion (Lithium Iron Phosphate, LiFePO4) battery pack was measured by applying a fixed quantity of charge and discharge current between 0.2C and 2C rates and at SOCs between 10% and 90% at an average temperature of 23°C.},

In this paper, we fill this gap by performing a comprehensive comparison of seven different energy management strategies, each with different levels of practicality, sophistication and computational requirements. We analyse the results in the context of these three characteristics, and also critique the modelling assumptions made by each strategy. Our analysis finds that using a more sophisticated energy management strategy may not necessarily improve the performance and economic viability of the PV-battery system due to the effects of modelling assumptions, such as the treatment of uncertainties in the input data and battery degradation effects.},

Estimating battery life-span, and optimising battery management to increase it, is difficult given the associated complex, multi-factor ageing process. In this paper we present a battery life prediction methodology tailored towards operational optimisation of battery management. The methodology is able to consider a multitude of dynamically changing cycling parameters. For lithium-ion (Li-ion) cells, the methodology has been tailored to consider five operational factors: charging and discharging currents, minimum and maximum cycling limits, and operating temperature. These are captured within four independent models, which are tuned using experimental battery data. Incorporation of dynamically changing factors is done using rainflow counting and discretisation. The resulting methodology is designed for solving optimal battery operation problems.Implementation of the methodology is presented for two case studies: a smartphone battery, and a household with battery storage alongside solar generation. For a smartphone that charges daily, our analysis finds that the battery life can be more than doubled if the maximum charging limit is chosen strategically. And for the battery supporting domestic solar, it is found that the impact of large daily cycling outweighs that of small more frequent cycles. This suggests that stationary Li-ion batteries may be well suited to provide ancillary services as a secondary function.The developed methodology and demonstrated use cases represent a key step towards maximising the cost-benefit of Li-ion batteries for any given application.},

In particular, we focus on energy arbitrage, as this is a potential future large-scale application of energy storage and there is limited existing research combining the modelling of battery degradation and energy storage arbitrage. We implement two different representations of battery degradation within an energy arbitrage model, and show that degradation has a strong impact on battery energy storage system (BESS) profitability. In a case study using historical electricity market prices from the MISO electricity market in the United States, we find that the achievable net present value (at an interest rate of 10%) for a battery system with a C-rate of 1C dropped from 358 $/kWh in the case considering no degradation to 194–314 $/kWh depending on the battery degradation model and assumptions for end of life (EOL) criteria. This corresponds to a reduction in revenue due to degradation in the 12–46% range. Moreover, we find that reducing the cycling of the battery via introducing a penalty cost in the objective function of the energy arbitrage optimization model can improve the profitability over the life of the BESS.},

In this paper, we present a highly scalable approach to find the optimal consumption levels for households in an iterative and distributed manner. The complexity of this approach is independent of the number of households, which allows it to be applied to problems with large groups of households.

As the agent facilitating the SHs' participation in the IBDR program, load aggregators (LAs) need to comprehend the available SHs' demand response (DR) capacity before trading in the day-ahead market. However, there are few studies that forecast the available aggregated DR capacity from LAs' perspective. Therefore, this article proposes a forecasting model aiming to aid LAs forecast the available aggregated SHs' DR capacity in the day-ahead market. First, a home energy management system is implemented to perform optimal scheduling for SHs and to model the customers' responsive behavior in the IBDR program; second, a customer baseline load estimation method is applied to quantify the SHs' aggregated DR capacity during DR days; third, several features which may have significant impacts on the aggregated DR capacity are extracted and they are processed by principal component analysis; and finally, a support vector machine based forecasting model is proposed to forecast the aggregated SHs' DR capacity in the day-ahead market. The case study indicates that the proposed forecasting framework could provide good performance in terms of stability and accuracy.},

  abstract = {It is challenging to engage customers in demand response programs, which require significant interventions in customers’ normal energy consumption patterns. Moreover, little is known about how customers can be motivated to adopt innovations that promote collective benefits. This research investigates the effectiveness of the two most basic elements of incentive-based policies — reward and punishment — with regard to customer participation in the sustainable energy domain. We counter the prevailing assumptions in innovation and technology research that favor the use of reward rather than punishment to engage customers. Based on a series of experimental studies, we find mixed evidence. It appears that punishment is at least as effective as reward in engaging customers in sustainable technology innovations. Even more importantly, both reward and punishment are shown to overcome concerns relating to technology. Moderated mediation reveals that economic incentives and disincentives ameliorate critical obstacles because customers more strongly favor their own personal benefit over the collective benefit and are more willing for ‘self-serving’ reasons to adopt technology that contributes to collective benefits. The findings of this research thus have novel practical and theoretical implications for energy innovation involving customers.},

This chapter provides an overview of global constraints. It discusses different types of constraints, measures of filtering and different compromises between efficiency and effectiveness of filtering. It describes global constraint as a constraint that captures a relation between a nonfixed numbers of variables. The chapter reviews one of the central ideas of constraint programming: the propagation-search technique that consists of a traversal of the search space of the given constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) while detecting “dead ends” as early as possible. An algorithm that performs only the search component would enumerate all possible assignments of values to the variables until it either finds a solution to the CSP or exhausts all possible assignments and concludes that a solution does not exist. Such an exhaustive search has an exponential time complexity in the best case, and this is where propagation comes in: it allows the constraint solver to prune useless parts of the search space without enumerating them. The chapter also describes global optimization constraints—that is, constraints that encapsulate optimization criteria and filtering algorithms for them.},

This chapter explores that there are three main algorithmic techniques for solving constraint satisfaction problems: (1) backtracking search, (2) local search, and (3) dynamic programming. An algorithm for solving a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) can be either complete or incomplete. Complete or systematic algorithms, come with a guarantee of a solution if one exists, and can be used to show that a CSP does not have a solution and to find a provably optimal solution. Backtracking search algorithms and dynamic programming algorithms are examples of complete algorithms. Incomplete, or nonsystematic algorithms, cannot be used to show a CSP does not have a solution or to find a provably optimal solution. However, such algorithms are often effective at finding a solution if one exists and can be used to find an approximation to an optimal solution. Of the two classes of algorithms that are complete—backtracking search and dynamic programming—backtracking search algorithms are currently the most important in practice. These work on only one solution at a time and thus need only a polynomial amount of space.},

This chapter describes constraint-based scheduling as the discipline that studies how to solve scheduling problems by using constraint programming (CP). Constraint-based planning in turn is the discipline that studies how to solve planning problems by CP. The chapter discusses that constraint-based scheduling is one of the most successful application areas of CP. One of the key factors of this success lies in the fact that a combination was found of the best of two fields of research that pay attention to scheduling—namely, operations research (OR) and artificial intelligence (AI). The chapter reviews that OR approach aims at achieving a high level of efficiency in its algorithms whereas AI research tends to investigate more general scheduling models and tries to solve the problems by using general problem-solving paradigms. The use of CP in planning is because of the problem complexity, which is less mature than its use in scheduling. Constraint-based planning thus follows the same pattern as constraint-based scheduling where CP is used as a framework for integrating efficient special purpose algorithms into a flexible and expressive paradigm. It also presents CP models for scheduling together with descriptions of propagation techniques for constraints used in these models.},

  abstract  = {This new edition covers the central concepts of practical optimization techniques,
with an emphasis on methods that are both state-of-the-art and popular. One major
insight is the connection between the purely analytical character of an optimization
problem and the behavior of algorithms used to solve a problem. This was a major theme
of the first edition of this book and the fourth edition expands and further illustrates
this relationship. As in the earlier editions, the material in this fourth edition
is organized into three separate parts. Part I is a self-contained introduction to
linear programming. The presentation in this part is fairly conventional, covering
the main elements of the underlying theory of linear programming, many of the most
effective numerical algorithms, and many of its important special applications. Part
II, which is independent of Part I, covers the theory of unconstrained optimization,
including both derivations of the appropriate optimality conditions and an introduction
to basic algorithms. This part of the book explores the general properties of algorithms
and defines various notions of convergence. Part III extends the concepts developed
in the second part to constrained optimization problems. Except for a few isolated
sections, this part is also independent of Part I. It is possible to go directly into
Parts II and III omitting Part I, and, in fact, the book has been used in this way
in many universities.New to this edition is a chapter devoted to Conic Linear Programming,
a powerful generalization of Linear Programming. Indeed, many conic structures are
possible and useful in a variety of applications. It must be recognized, however,
that conic linear programming is an advanced topic, requiring special study. Another
important topic is an accelerated steepest descent method that exhibits superior convergence
properties, and for this reason, has become quite popular. The proof of the convergence
property for both standard and accelerated steepest descent methods are presented
in Chapter 8. As in previous editions, end-of-chapter exercises appear for all chapters.From
the reviews of the Third Edition: this very well-written book is a classic textbook
in Optimization. It should be present in the bookcase of each student, researcher,
and specialist from the host of disciplines from which practical optimization applications
are drawn. (Jean-Jacques Strodiot, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1207, 2011)},

to automatically solve these problems. However, the state-of-the-art constraint solvers

solutions inefficiently. This paper presents a novel and model-driven approach---SoGen---to
synthesize efficient problem-specific solvers from constraint models. Namely, when
users model a CP with our domain-specific language PDL (short for Problem Description
Language), SoGen automatically analyzes various properties of the problem (e.g., search
space, value boundaries, function monotonicity, and overlapping subproblems), synthesizes
an efficient solver algorithm based on those properties, and generates a C program
as the problem solver. PDL is unique because it can create solvers that resolve constraints
via dynamic programming (DP) search.  For evaluation, we compared the solvers generated
by SoGen with two state-of-the-art constraint solvers: Gecode and Chuffed. PDL's solvers
resolved constraints more efficiently; they achieved up to 6,058x speedup over Gecode
and up to 31,300x speedup over Chuffed. Additionally, we experimented with both SoGen
and the state-of-the-art solver generator---Dominion. We found SoGen to generate solvers
faster and the produced solvers are more efficient.},

This approach may bring useful insights for distribution companies and regulatory agencies, helping to shift thinking to a more user-centric approach. The emergent properties of electricity consumption are modeled by the means of consumer’s heuristics, taking into account the electricity price, consumer’s satisfaction level, willingness to invest in new technologies, social interactions, and marketing strategies by the power utility. Analysis on the emergent behavior of this approach through simulation studies showed that it is indeed valuable, as does not require in-depth data of all details on human behavior.

Our models produced schedules that allowed more cargo throughput for someproblems than the ﬁxed-draft and manual scheduling ap-proaches, and were able to solve problems of realistic size. Our CP and MIP models included constraints on the avail-ability of tugs, which were highly sequence dependent and made the problem computationally difﬁcult. We were able tosolve this problem by splitting the tug constraints into sev-eral scenarios which could be handled separately.We found that the CP model with a good choice of searchstrategy was signiﬁcantly faster and was able to solve larger problems than the MIP model. We also compared several variations on our original CP model, and investigated their effects on solution time},

  abstract = {Abstract The final step of the typical process of developing educational and psychological tests is to place the selected test items in a formatted form. The step involves the grouping and ordering of the items to meet a variety of formatting constraints. As this activity tends to be time-intensive, the use of mixed-integer programming (MIP) has been proposed to automate it. The goal of this article is to show how constraint programming (CP) can be used as an alternative to automate test-form generation problems with a large variety of formatting constraints, and how it compares with MIP-based form generation as for its models, solutions, and running times. Two empirical examples are presented: (i) automated generation of a computerized fixed-form; and (ii) automated generation of shadow tests for multistage testing. Both examples show that CP works well with feasible solutions and running times likely to be better than that for MIP-based applications.},

  abstract = {Today, implementation of an efficient and economical energy management system (EMS) in industrial smart grids- given the rising trend in electrical load consumption and restrictions in ramping up the power plants' capacities- cannot be underestimated. Optimal planning avails itself of the exploitation manner of existing energy resources alongside appropriate employment of demand response (DR) programs and available electric vehicles (EV) in parking lots of immense industrial centers as storage sites in energy management systems in industrial smart grids have been seriously considered. This article introduces a new perspective in the simultaneous use of demand response loads and available electric vehicles in parking lots toward energy management of industrial virtual power plants (IVPPs) aiming at augmenting the system's profits as well as increasing the grid reliability under peak load conditions and cutting down on industrial centers load shedding. The objective function of the problem is formulated within the framework of short-term production planning for distributed energy resources (DER) and conventional ones in conjunction with DR programs and EV in such a way that the IVPPs' profits are maximized. In order to validate the performance of the proposed method, we have applied and tried on the second zone of IEEE-RTS standard grid. The outcomes accrued from various simulations point to the fact that the presence of EV within the boundaries of EV's parking lots prompts considerable increase in IVPPs' storage amount and consequent decline in exploiting full power grid capacity. Utilizing DR programs for responding load and selecting best scheduling schemes for each IVPP during various times of a day-night cycles will bring about a reduction in operation costs, de-peaking as well as an enhanced performance of EV's parking installations.},

  abstractnote = {&lt;p&gt;Computation of equilibria for congestion games has been an important research subject. In many realistic scenarios, each strategy of congestion games is given by a combination of elements that satisfies certain constraints; such games are called combinatorial congestion games. For example, given a road network with some toll roads, each strategy of routing games is a path (a combination of edges) whose total toll satisfies a certain budget constraint. Generally, given a ground set of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; elements, the set of all such strategies, called the strategy set, can be large exponentially in &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, and it often has complicated structures; these issues make equilibrium computation very hard. In this paper, we propose a practical algorithm for such hard equilibrium computation problems. We use data structures, called zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams (ZDDs), to compactly represent strategy sets, and we develop a Frank–Wolfe-style iterative equilibrium computation algorithm whose per-iteration complexity is linear in the size of the ZDD representation. We prove that an ϵ-approximate Wardrop equilibrium can be computed in &lt;em&gt;O&lt;/em&gt;(poly(&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;)/&lt;em&gt;ϵ&lt;/em&gt;) iterations, and we improve the result to &lt;em&gt;O&lt;/em&gt;(poly(&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;) log &lt;em&gt;ϵ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) for some special cases. Experiments confirm the practical utility of our method.&lt;/p&gt;},

  abstract  = {The emerging proliferation of information and communication technology throughout the electricity grid enables technologies, such as Demand Response (DR) schemes, eventually creating a Smart Grid. This development is expected to produce effective DR systems where consumers get reduced electricity costs while their utility companies reduce their costs of services due to peak demand reductions with increasing efficiency. False data injection/data integrity attacks on these systems can potentially result in sub-optimal solutions for a majority of users while a potentially malicious subset of users receives benefits. Furthermore, such attacks might also affect the resilience of the Smart Grid. In this paper, we depicted a novel high impact FDIA and evaluate how an adversary can use a targeted strategic data integrity attack in order to get financial benefits through a realtime based pricing scheme. Our experimental results show how a small percentage of overall demand increase can lead to a significant cost reduction for the adversary. Based on our results we elaborate on the significance of this type of false data injection attacks on general distributed DR schemes.},

This paper presents a comprehensive review categorically on the recent advances and previous research developments of the smart grid paradigm over the last two decades. The main intent of the study is to provide an application-focused survey where every category and sub-category herein are thoroughly and independently investigated. The preamble of the paper highlights the concept and the structure of the smart grids. The work presented intensively and extensively reviews the recent advances on the energy data management in smart grids, pricing modalities in a modernized power grid, and the predominant components of the smart grid. The paper thoroughly enumerates the recent advances in the area of network reliability. On the other hand, the reliance on smart cities on advanced communication infrastructure promotes more concerns regarding data integrity. Therefore, the paper dedicates a sub-section to highlight the challenges and the state-of-the-art of cybersecurity. Furthermore, highlighting the emerging developments in the pricing mechanisms concludes the review.},

The EMS consists of two stages: first a deterministic management model is formulated and subsequently is integrated into a rolling horizon control strategy, in which the actions on microgrid devices respond to an optimization criterion related to the estimation of the future system behaviour that is continually predicted by updatable forecasts in order to reduce uncertainty in both, production capacity and energy demand. Finally, this contribution presents and discusses a case study where the results of the operation with and without optimal demand management for the same group of loads are evaluated.},

The complex energy landscape is thoroughly analysed to accurately determine the two key factors of this framework: the total demand of the energy products directed to the end-use sectors, and the corresponding price of each product. A rolling horizon predictive methodology is introduced to estimate future energy demands, with excellent predictive capability, shown over a period of 174 months.

In this work, the recent experimental evidence that demonstrates that degradation in lithium-ion batteries is non-linearly dependent on the operating conditions is incorporated. Experimental aging data of a commercial battery have been used to develop a scheduling model applicable to the time constraints of a market model.

  abstract = {The rapid adoption of Li-ion batteries in electric vehicles, merchant storage applications, and as providers of ancillary services to the electric grid, requires the development of tractable and accurate models for their reliable operation. For such operations, it is common practice to use generic and ideal storage mathematical models, i.e., models in which the storage efficiency and power limits are considered constant; resulting in a possible miscalculation of the flexibility and profit gained from the use of storage units. To promote a more accurate characterization of energy storage operation, we propose a linear model representing the variable efficiencies and power limits; for both battery charging and discharging processes. Based on a battery equivalent circuit model, we analyze the non-convex behavior of the power limits and efficiencies. Through the use of a methodology for the piece-wise approximation of a concave function, we derive a linear model that characterizes both the battery power limits and the efficiencies as affine functions of the level of stored energy and the power charged/discharged. The proposed linear model is compared with a generic one under a centralized economic dispatch and merchant storage operation. A reliability analysis of the use of generic storage models is presented, highlighting the impact on the system’s flexibility derived from the simplifications present in this model. The use of the proposed model guarantees the feasibility of the battery scheduling, preventing additional compensation costs for both the system operator and merchant investor.},
